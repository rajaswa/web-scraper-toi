Guwahati's 35-year-old Junali (name changed on request), who lost her husband three years ago to HIV/AIDS, is among thousands of HIV-positive people in northeast India and elsewhere excited by the prospects of finding a good match through the website.""I am pinning all my hopes to find a genuine match on the proposed website. I want to live a life with dignity and want someone who is intelligent, sober, and caring,"" Junali told IANS.The websiteto be launched later this month at the behest of the Indian Network for People Living with HIV/AIDS (INP+) has already generated a lot of interest among HIV- positive people.""We have already got about 150 to 200 requests for membership despite the fact that the website is yet to be launched,"" Jahnabi Goswami, president of INP+, said.Goswami, 32, is one of the few women in India fighting to raise awareness about the disease. She belongs to an even smaller group of people who have publicly declared that they are HIV- positive.Membership to the website would be open only to people living with HIV/AIDS. ""Strict privacy would be maintained and only registered members will be able to log in and scan profiles of prospective partners,"" Goswami said.There are thousands of people living with HIV/AIDS interested in marriage and leading a normal life with dignity, but since they cannot get in touch with like-minded people, their dreams remained unfulfilled.""It is an excellent idea to have this website as marriages between an HIV- positive couple would enable them not only to lead a happy life but also to take care of and support each other, which is very important,"" S.I.

With his previous experience as chair of the AIDS Clinical Trials Group, reputedly among the most productive multinational research organizations working on HIV pathogenesis and therapy, Schooley was an important contributor to the two-day ART Symposium in the city organized by YRG Care over the weekend to discuss cutting-edge technology in the field.Speaking to TOI on Sunday about new scientific advances in the field, Schooley said, ""There are a host of approaches being adopted by researchers worldwide to try and eradicate HIV however the approaches using either enzymes or RNA to remove infected cells are ultimately the most hopeful and will be the least disruptive for the patient. Paula Cannon, a researcher from California, for instance, has been working on ways to identify HIV-infected cells called CD4 cells (so called because they have a molecule on the surface called CD4) which is a gateway for the virus. These cells have a second molecule called CCR5 which is a second door that the virus has to pass through. Now, she has created a way for the second molecule to be changed so that they virus cannot recognize it. In this approach, the virus stays outside the cell."" Elaborating on Cannon's research, he said she had been able to demonstrate it successfully in mice.""The next step will be to take people with HIV infection who have lymphoma and so, would need a bone marrow transplant for their tumours. She would treat the stem cells and hopefully the bone marrow so grafted would afford the patients' cells protection from HIV,"" Schooley said. Pointing out that this was an experiment that had to be done, he cited the example of a similar case but with a natural modification of the CCR5 molecule being reported in the New York Journal of Medicine about 18 months ago. ""After the HIV-infected individual underwent a bone marrow transplant from such a donor, no one could demonstrate the presence of HIV in the patient. So, there is certainly some preliminary support for her research,"" he said.Commenting on India's research potential, Schooley said that biotechnology was growing at an excellent pace in the country. ""There is some state of the art research work being carried out by YRG Care and some fantastically sophisticated research at National Aids Research Institute, Pune. In fact, the component sites that we have in Chennai and Pune are among the most productive. We are carrying out trials on the best drugs to use for HIV infections, treating people with drug failure and drug resistance and treating people suffering from HIV and Tuberculosis at the same time. There is a lot of important work being carried out over here. India is one of the best places for research activity worldwide,"" he added.","['hiv', 'schooley', 'hopeful', 'research', 'researchers', 'second', 'virus', 'called', 'cells', 'working', 'finding', 'molecule', 'marrow', 'cure']","These cells have a second molecule called CCR5 which is a second door that the virus has to pass through.

The hapless woman was thrown out by her husband after she had tested HIV+ during delivery of her baby last year. Although she got the infection from her husband but the latter refuses to keep her saying that he has no money to bear the cost of treatment. He has also kept the baby with him.“I knocked at every door possible, be it NGOs or government organisations but only got sympathies,” said Poonam while narrating how her husband snatched her four-month-old daughter from her and threw her out of the house. “With no money and means of livelihood, I first went to my parents but my father was also not ready to accept me. My mother, however, intervened and helped me in approaching various government agencies and NGOs for help. However, at all the places people only made promises but none helped,” she rued. Poonam only want a job so that she can be financially independent and can claim custody of her daughter.In her letter, Poonam has described how hundreds of HIV+ women like her who want to stand on their feet and fight stigma but are being pushed back by government agencies and NGOs who thrive on grants procured in the name of HIV/AIDS awareness and welfare. “I hope being a women chief minister will help me out,” said Poonam who signed the letter “one of your daughter”. A dejected Poonam has also said that she would be forced to commit suicide, if no help came from the chief minister. “ What option do I have...should I take to prostitution and infect others...or beg on streets... better to end life,” she said.Poonam was just 16 when she was married to one Rajesh, who works as salesman in a small firm. The marriage does not have a legal sanctity because she was minor at that time. She has studied till class XI, which is also not enough to get a job. “ I understand the limitations but I am only asking for a job, may be a peon or a counsellor at any AIDS awareness centre or any task which may earn enough to take care of myself,” she said. At present, she survives on little money her mother sends every month. During the day, she wanders on the streets looking for work and in the night finds shelter in railways and bus stations.The woman also knocked the door of the State Women Commission and State Aids Control Society as well as other NGOs working for HIV positive people but got only assurances. The episode has also exposed the poor state of affairs in government set up for providing relief and rehabilitation to abandoned HIV+ women and children. There are over 1000 NGOs, funded by the government and other national international organisations, working in the field of HIV/AIDS in UP but none have any shelter home, barring ‘Shanti Niketan’ run by the ‘Sisters of Saint Joseph’, a Christian missionary organisation, but it has limited capacity.The state has over 1.4 lakh HIV+ people, of which nearly 30% are widows who acquired infection from their husbands but after their death were disowned by in-laws. Many like Poonam are denied shelter by their parents as well. Some also have children. The only option for them is to lead a traumatised life and die in oblivion. Officers claim that government gives enough funds to the NGOs for the job. The Lucknow Network for People living with HIV and AIDS has been helping such widows but resources are limited. Members complain that NGOs take grants in the name of HIV/AIDS but have done more harm to victims than infection.","['hiv', 'ngos', 'money', 'shelter', 'poonam', 'job', 'dumped', 'organisations', 'husband', 'women', 'woman', 'seeks', 'help', 'state', 'cms']","The hapless woman was thrown out by her husband after she had tested HIV+ during delivery of her baby last year.

In India, over 60% of HIV-infected patients with a weak immunity system get infected with TB and ultimately die of it.Scientists from Dartmouth Medical School (DMS) have reported results of their clinical trial of this new vaccine against TB -- Mycobacterium vaccae (MV) -- in the January 29 online issue of the journal AIDS. The study will be published in the March print issue of the journal.Principal investigator Ford von Reyn from DMS said, ""Since development of a new vaccine against TB is a major international health priority, especially for patients with HIV infection, we and our Tanzanian collaborators are very encouraged by the results of the study.""The vaccine is a type known as an inactivated, whole-cell mycobacterial vaccine and is expected to be economical to produce and distribute.Von Reyn described the trial as a ""significant milestone -- the first to demonstrate that any type of vaccine can prevent an infectious complication of HIV in adults"".He added that the next steps are to improve the manufacturing methods to support the production of the larger quantities of the TB vaccine needed for further studies and subsequent clinical use.Health ministry officials in Delhi say the vaccine gives tremendous hope to India which has a huge burden of both TB and HIV patients.Of the over two million HIV-infected Indians, over 10% are expected to have full blown AIDS. Every AIDS patient has 15% chance every year of developing TB, which shows that every AIDS patient will develop TB some time in his life.""That's why under India's latest AIDS control programme, we are dealing with TB and HIV simultaneously. When people become infected with TB and AIDS, it is almost always an irreversible formula,"" ministry officials said.Since newly-infected HIV patients risk contracting TB almost immediately, investigators are targeting a strategy for immunization with MV before patients need to start taking antiretroviral drugs.The scientific team at Dartmouth began Phase-I human studies with MV in the United States in 1994 and demonstrated that a multiple-dose series of MV was safe in both healthy subjects and patients with HIV infection.The group then conducted Phase-II studies in larger groups of adults in Zambia and in Finland. In the Zambian trial, researchers found that MV boosted immune responses against TB that had first been primed in childhood with the current TB vaccine, BCG.Subsequently, the DarDar group received NIH funding to conduct the large Phase-III efficacy trial among HIV-infected patients with prior BCG immunization in Tanzania.HIV patients are particularly vulnerable to TB because their immune systems are compromised. The vaccine works by boosting the immune responses of patients who have already been given the BCG vaccine earlier in life.","['hiv', 'mv', 'aids', 'tb', 'hivinfected', 'patients', 'vaccine', 'getting', 'trial', 'prevent', 'shot', 'studies', 'immune']","NEW DELHI: A vaccine to protect HIV patients from contracting tuberculosis (TB) and ultimately dying of it has finally become a reality.After a seven-year-long trial in Africa, scientists have for the first time developed a vaccine that was succesful in reducing the rate of definite TB infection by almost 39% among 2,000 HIV-infected patients in Tanzania.TB is the biggest killer of HIV-infected patients in the world.

A resident of the central suburbs, he proudly announces unlike many HIV-positive patients, he has never been bedridden by frequent bouts of illnesses.He credits his health to his family and hisemployer, the Indian Railways, who have been supportive ever since he was diagnosed with HIV while randomly donating blood at a donation camp way back in 1997.The unusual patient scaled another height three months back; he became the first HIV-positive person in Maharashtra to undergo a kidney transplant . In the stigma-ridden world of HIV/AIDS, 45-year-old Jha's story holds out hope for the two-million-plus Indians living with HIV.In Jha's case, his 64-year-old mother Sitara donated one of her kidneys to her first-born son. ""I just want to see my child living healthily next to me,"" she said over the phone from Benares.The transplant is a milestone of sorts. Not surprisingly then, Jha's nephrologist Dr M Bahadur, transplant surgeon Shailesh Raina and medical consultant Dr Om Srivasatava are ecstatic with his progress since the transplant was carried out at Jaslok Hospital last November 26.""This is the first time in Maharashtra that a HIV-positive person has got a transplant. It needs experienced specialists to manage the patient carefully so as to ensure that his body doesn't reject the donor organ while ensuring that the HIV infection doesn't flare up,"" Bahadur, who has been treating Jha since 2006, said.Admitting that it had indeed been a challenge to handle a HIV-positive patient, Srivastava said that the right medical environment (as in a super-speciality hospital like Jaslok), right protocol and medicines were needed for such transplants. ""If the HIV-positive patient's CD4 count is adequate and his viral load is negative, then he can safely undergo a transplant,"" added the Jaslok doctors.Worldwide, too, transplants for HIV-positive patients are a relatively new concept. In 2004, the US reported about a 100-odd liver and kidney transplants for HIV-positive patients.The man himself is calm. ""My HIV status was detected in 1997 and my kidney failure in 2006."" He was on dialysis for three years before doctors realised that transplant would be the only hope for him. ""In my 13 years with HIV, I took only 77 days of leave but I needed over three months of leave for the kidney transplant and the minor problems that cropped up after it,"" he said.Jha also believes that his employer, the Railways, played a great role in his ""healthy but HIV"" status. ""I have had access to antiretroviral drugs for the past 10 years. I was never discriminated against or passed up for promotion at my workplace. My dialysis would cost tens of thousands of rupees but the railways always paid up. They even paid for my transplant,"" added the father of two.Dr Harsh Jauhari, one of the seniormost nephrologists in the country, said that while a couple of HIV-positive patients had undergone transplants in India, little was chronicled about these special patients. ""There is a confidentially clause with HIV-positive patients that cannot be tampered with. So it is likely that we don't know about all the transplants that have taken place in this category. But there is no denying that these patients need specialised care,"" added the Delhi-based Jauhari.Another senior doctor said there were several issues about safety about the medical staff involved as well that had not allowed HIV-positive transplants so far.Incidentally, a study published in the Archives of Surgery last year by the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine said that HIV-positive kidney transplant recipients could have the same one-year survival rates for themselves and their donor organs as those without HIV, if certain risk factors for transplant failure were recognized and tightly managed.According to the report, ""HIV patients were earlier not considered transplant candidates as researchers thought that the survival rates after transplantation were greatly compromised by the disease, which cripples the body's immune system. Also, transplant patients take drugs that suppress their immune systems in order to prevent organ rejection, a regimen thought to further threaten their already fragile immune systems.""(The patient's name has been changed.)","['transplant', 'hiv', 'op', 'medical', 'patients', 'hivpositive', 'transplants', 'kidney', 'jhas', 'rare', 'patient', 'gets', 'railways', 'india']","""This is the first time in Maharashtra that a HIV-positive person has got a transplant.

One per cent of the city's 15,000 street children (in the age group of 5-14) are HIV-positive, but were not aware of the fact that they were carrying the deadly virus, reveals a survey conducted by the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED), Kolkata.Most victims did not even know how the disease got transmitted or its symptoms and had contracted the lethal virus through sexual abuse, says the survey. While around 4% suffered from other sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis, nearly 10% of these youngsters faced sexual abuse before turning 16.Titled Non-tobacco Substance Use, Sexual Abuse, HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infection Among Street Children in Kolkata', the study was carried out across 58 municipal wards of the city. More than 550 street children, who have no family, were interviewed and observed from 2007 to 2009. Random blood samples were collected to check the prevalence of diseases like HIV, hepatitis B and sexually transmitted diseases. The results have left the team of researchers shocked.""One per cent of these children were HIV-positive which is a big number. Being marginalised and without any access to medical care, they will probably never come to know of their HIV status. Or, by the time they do, they will have infected others. This is an alarming situation since the urban homeless often act as a bridge between the infected population and those who are at risk. We need immediate intervention to check a potential epidemic,"" said Kamalesh Sarkar, deputy director, division of epidemiology, NICED. Sarkar led a five-member research team for the study.While no specific age of the HIV victims could be established from the random survey, all were below 16 years. Inquiring into the reasons behind the spread of the virus, the researchers found that most had faced sexual abuse. ""A minor percentage might have got the virus from sex workers. It is quite possible that they passed it on to others since both sexual abuse and promiscuity was common among street children. It is unlikely that any had got the virus from their parents,"" said Sarkar.The study reveals that while 26% of male street children faced sexual abuse before they turned 15, 13% of the girls who faced abuse were above 15 years. Around 13% of the boys who visited sex workers suffered from sexually transmitted diseases.""Without any shelter or protection, these children will continue to be vulnerable. Moreover, they had no idea of HIV or that they could end up carrying the virus and infect others. Since there has never been any such study in the past, it is difficult to say if the number is rising. But unless steps are taken, it will definitely spiral and pose a serious health hazard which we are probably not ready to deal with,"" said Baishali Bal, one of the researchers.Less than half of the street children got two square meals a day, more than 85% slept in public places and earned less than Rs 1,000 a month. Substance abuse, the study disclosed, was extremely high among them. Thirty per cent used non-tobacco substances like adhesives, brown sugar, cocaine and alcohol.NICED has proposed shelters and support centres for street children at railway stations. ""It is at places like stations and markets that they generally tend to camp in search of work and food.

The survey, comprising a sample of 721 MSM from 18 different cities in the state, found 9% of MSM to be HIV-infected.""The sustained campaign by the government about the use of condoms and its various awareness programmes for sex workers (the prevalence of HIV among them decreased from 9% in 2003 to 4.7% in 2007) and truck drivers have clearly shown results. But things remain unchanged as far as MSM and drug users are concerned,"" says Dr Sunil Suhas Solomon, senior medical officer and epidemiologist at YRGCARE, who presented the data at the 16th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Montreal last year.""MSM remain a hidden population in India primarily due to Section 377 of the IPC, which has historically criminalised sex between men, and also the societal and family pressures to marry. Hence, there is very little community-level data of HIV among MSM. So we used a technique called peer-driven recruitment, which uses MSM to recruit other MSM to arrive at the study sample,"" says Dr Solomon.The study also documented the existence of HIV epidemics among MSM in many smaller cities such as Tirunelveli, Ramanathapuram and Tuticorin, which are usually not included in the planning of interventions targeted at MSM. Also, more interesting was the finding that the prevalence of HIV and sexually transmitted infections among MSM who were married is double compared to MSM who were not married.""About 35% of our sample of MSM were married. The higher prevalence of HIV infection among MSM who were married could partially be explained by their nature to keep their same sex practices even more hidden. Consequently, they ended up having more male partners, which has been shown by many studies to be a strong risk factor for HIV infection,"" explains Dr Solomon.Sahodaran, an organisation that works with MSM, conducted a similary survey recently in association with the Tuberculosis Research Centre in Chetpet and found that 8% of MSM in Chennai were HIV infected. But Sunil Menon, who runs Sahodaran, says there is no tangible evidence to back such figures because the gay community still remains hidden. ""Maybe the figure is shown rising just because more people are testing now than they did before. So there is no way of saying whether the prevalence is increasing, decreasing or remains the same,"" says Menon.Says Dr Solomon, ""The current phase of the National AIDS Control Programme has initiatives targeting MSM. Only time will tell the effectiveness of these programmes but the government needs to be applauded for the fact that it recognizes HIV among MSM as an issue and is taking steps to address it. However, it is equally important to address issues related to the families (wives and children) of these marginalised populations who are also being placed at risk via their spouses' behaviors.""","['hiv', 'sex', 'survey', 'prevalence', 'dr', 'msm', 'shown', 'men', 'sample', 'rise', 'infection']","The survey, comprising a sample of 721 MSM from 18 different cities in the state, found 9% of MSM to be HIV-infected.

To explain what that means, here's a brief HIV family history: Most people who get HIV and proceed to AIDS are infected with a member of the HIV-1 family of viruses. HIV-1 is divided into groups; most AIDS-related strains of the virus come from group M. The groups are further subdivided into what are known as clades.Clade B is the form of group M HIV-1 most often found in the United States and western Europe, and the one that is probably best-studied to date. Clade C, the clade studied by the Caltech team, is ""the one that is devastating Africa and Asia,"" said Diskin. ""It's the one that probably causes the largest number of infections worldwide.""In order to uncover the structure of clade C gp120--and determine if the hypothesis about its similarities was indeed true — the Caltech team needed to crystallize the protein. That was no easy task. Turns out, says Diskin, the protein itself is not stiff enough for crystallization. And so the researchers created a complex of molecules consisting of a gp120 monomer, a CD4 receptor, and an anti-HIV antibody known as 21c.","['hiv', 'gp120', 'clade', 'hope', 'vaccine', 'hiv1', 'protein', 'c', 'structure', 'team', 'shot', 'unveiled', 'known']","""There's a tremendous continuing effort to develop a vaccine for HIV and most of those efforts use gp120.

They modified some of the cells, using a brand-new enzyme “cutter” to delete the famous CCR delta 32 section.As a result, when these cells matured and divided, they lacked the key code for making normal CCR5.The modified cells were reinjected back into the rodents, which were then exposed to HIV. Twelve weeks after infection, the animals had recovered their stock of immune T-cells and their levels of HIV were very low.But “control” mice that had not received the modified cells were highly infected and their immune systems weak.If the approach is found to be safe and effective on humans, it opens the way to creating a long-term generation of HIV-resistant T-cells in the body—in other words, a patient could suppress HIV without taking powerful antiretroviral drugs.The experiment headed by Paula Cannon of the University of Southern California , Los Angeles, and reported in the journal Nature Biotechnology, is the third avenue that has opened up for CCR5 investigators.Drugs that inhibit CCR5 are already being licensed as “salvage” therapy for patients whose immune systems have been crippled by HIV. Doctors are also testing in trials on volunteers a CCR delta 32 technique, but using T-cells as opposed to stem cells.“It’s a one-shot treatment if it works,” noted study co-author Paula Cannon, associate professor of molecular microbiology at the University of Southern California. In gene therapy, doctors try to coax the human body into doing something differently by tweaking its genetic structure. To treat HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, scientists have been experimenting with using gene therapy to boost the immune system.","['hiv', 'tcells', 'modified', 'virus', 'therapy', 'immune', 'cells', 'scientists', 'created', 'fight', 'using', 'ccr5']","They modified some of the cells, using a brand-new enzyme “cutter” to delete the famous CCR delta 32 section.As a result, when these cells matured and divided, they lacked the key code for making normal CCR5.The modified cells were reinjected back into the rodents, which were then exposed to HIV.

35,22-7-2010,['Kounteya Sinha'],https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg,"NEW DELHI: A simple blood test is now helping India identify the status of children born to HIV positive mothers as early as six weeks after their birth, instead of 18 months.Till recently, paediatricians in India, on detection of anti-HIV antibodies in children below 18 months, could never tell for sure whether they were already infected or the antibodies were transferred to them from their mother.Therefore, doctors couldn't even start the life-saving Anti-Retroviral Treatment -- the only effective way to treat HIV -- on them. This, according to National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), led to 33,000 new infants getting the infection every year from their HIV positive mothers.India, in March, rolled out the highly accurate DNA PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test in the four high prevalence states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra.Available in 767 Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) and 180 ART centres, the DNA PCR can test the blood sample of a child after it reaches six weeks of age and accurately say whether it is already infected with HIV or not.The antibody test available before March could only confirm the HIV status after the child reached 18 months of age.In the last three months, 45 children have been tested for HIV status. NACO hopes to roll out the test to 10,000 children born to HIV positive mothers by March next year.""As soon as the child of an HIV positive mother is older than six weeks, his or her blood sample is collected and transported to seven national labs for testing with DNA PCR which gives us a definitive diagnosis on the child's HIV status. The report is available in just a week,"" NACO's ART chief Dr B B Rewari told TOI before leaving for the International AIDS Conference in Vienna.Dr Rewari, who will present this data in Vienna, added, ""Usually, if such children aren't put on treatment, 50% of them die within the first year of birth if infected. So early diagnosis and treatment is vital.""Till now, India has detected 19,000 children with HIV.Unlike other tests, the HIV DNA PCR test does not rely on the presence of antigens or antibodies in the blood for diagnosis. Instead, it identifies genetic material by highlighting sequences of the virus within the subject's DNA.Experts say all babies born to mothers with HIV are born with HIV antibodies. Babies who are not infected lose their antibodies by the time they are about 18 months old. However, most babies can be diagnosed as either infected or uninfected by the time they are three months old by using DNA PCR test.""The PCR test is more sensitive than the HIV test, and is not used in the standard HIV testing of adults. It looks for the presence of HIV itself, not antibodies,"" a NACO official said.When a woman is tested HIV positive, she is offered special medical care to reduce the risk of her baby being infected. Some pregnant women with HIV decide to have their baby. Others choose to have a termination.""There are now very effective drugs that can reduce the risk of an HIV positive mother passing the virus to her baby in the womb or at birth. Delivery by elective Caesarean section also reduces the risk of a baby becoming infected. Beast-feeding in such cases increases the risk of the baby becoming infected,"" the official said.* An estimated 22.7 lakh Indians are infected with HIV* India has an HIV prevalence of 0.29%* It usually takes 10 years for HIV to become full blown AIDS* The first AIDS case in India was reported from Chennai, in 1986* Globally, more than 33 million people have AIDS or HIV, half of them women* Since the beginning of the epidemic in 1981, 60 million people have got infected with HIV and at least 25 million have died of AIDS","['hiv', 'positive', 'aids', 'children', 'blood', 'pcr', 'newborns', 'test', 'infected', 'helps', 'months', 'antibodies', 'status', 'identify', 'india']","NACO hopes to roll out the test to 10,000 children born to HIV positive mothers by March next year.

The drug can reduce a woman's chances of contracting HIV from an infected partner by 50% if used 12 hours before and after having sex.Interestingly, the gel had undergone a safety and acceptability trial on 100 women at National Aids Research Institute (NARI) in Pune in 2007. It can also reduce the risk of genital herpes by 51%.Being hailed as a major breakthrough globally, the CAPRISA trial followed 900 HIV-negative, sexually active South African women in the age group between 18 and 40.Two-and-a-half-years on, researchers found the gel reduced chances of HIV infection by 50% after a year and 39% after 30 months. The study revealed that those women -- who used the drug consistently nearly 80% of the time before having sex -- would be 54% less prone to infection.Health secretary K Sujatha Rao told TOI ""This is a major breakthrough, and will especially benefit India's 300,000-strong sex worker community involved in multi-partner sex. It will also help women who usually do not have the power to insist on condom use and fidelity, or to abandon partnerships that put them at high risk.""K Chandramouli, director general of National Aids Control Organisation. added, ""At present, India has 2.7 million HIV patients. We also record 1.7 lakh fresh cases of HIV every year, nearly 40% of which are women. Such a microbicide, once ready for implementation in our programme, will greatly benefit women.""According to NARI director Dr R S Paranjape, the gel underwent safety and acceptability study in India as well.""The preparatory work for the CAPRISA trial was conducted here along with the Microbicide Trials Network. The overall safety profile of the gel was good and it was well accepted by women. Presently, it provides 40% protection. The scientific community will now look at increasing this percentage,"" he explained.With a vaccine against HIV remaining elusive, scientists have for the past 20 years been looking for such an effective microbicide -- products such as gels, films, rings or creams that women could apply on their vagina to prevent HIV transmission.Finally, the breakthrough has happened, thanks to the microbicide that contains 1% Tenofovir.Tenofovir gel is an advanced second-generation HIV-specific microbicide that neither tries to kill the AIDS virus nor block it from entering the body as its predecessors. Instead, it is designed to prevent the virus from replicating when it comes in contact with an uninfected T-cell.Naturally, the virus will fail to survive for long to cause systemic infection.Women, who constitute 50% all new HIV cases globally, are also twice as likely as their male partners to contract HIV during unsafe sex. ""Tenofovir gel could fill an important HIV prevention gap by empowering women who are unable to successfully negotiate mutual faithfulness or condom use with their male partners,"" said study co- principal investigator Dr Quarraisha Abdool Karim. ""Eleven trials in the past 15 years have shown no change or even sometimes an increase in transmission rates. Tenofovir gel has a potential dual effect in preventing HIV. Since women with genital herpes are much more likely to become infected with HIV, the additional protection of tenofovir gel against herpes creates a second mechanism whereby the gel may have a bigger impact in preventing HIV,"" he explained.The gel is undergoing another Microbicide Trials Networks VOICE -- Vaginal and Oral Interventions to Control the Epidemic -- study that will provide evidence about the safety and efficacy of tenofovir gel used daily, irrespective of when participants have sex.Once this study is conducted, drug regulatory authorities will determine if the gel is safe and effective for HIV prevention. It may take another two years before public can use it.Michel Sidibe, executive director of UNAIDS, said, ""For the first time, we have seen results for a woman-initiated and controlled HIV prevention option.""","['vaginal', 'hiv', 'tenofovir', 'safety', 'aids', 'study', 'gel', 'sex', 'women', 'drug', 'microbicide', 'protection', 'offers', 'infection']","NEW DELHI: A vaginal gel can now protect women against HIV infection -- an innovation that scientists believe could be most crucial for reproductive health since the Pill.On Tuesday, scientists announced at the International Aids Conference in Vienna that they have successfully tested a gel, containing antiretroviral drug Tenofovir, which is usually taken as a tablet by HIV patients.

People sensitive to their plight can help in re-integrating them with the society by improving their living conditions and ensuring economic and social autonomy,'' said Augustine Veliath of Unicef.Besides producing a tool to sensitise people and create awareness, the kids had a great time. ""We began with learning to make faces using alphabets O and T. While O becomes the outline of the face, eyebrows, nose and mouth are sketched out of the T,'' said Mohit, who actively participated in the workshop.Sharad Sharma, founder World Comics India who taught the kids how to draw, added that with a little practice, children switch over from simple faces to the ones carrying expressions.

An ongoing study by the KEM Hospital to find out the efficacy of ayurvedic drugs in improving the life expectancy of HIV positive patients has yielded some positive results.The medicine department of the hospital has been studying the potency of an ayurvedic drug on 700 HIV patients since April last year. After little more than a year, the institute found a significant boost in the count of CD4 cells in these patients, and also that it could probably push the initiation of anti-retroviral therapy (ART), known to have many side-effects, by a few years.The count of CD4 cells is directly proportional to the health of a person for these cells are the most important part of one's immune system. Anyone with less CD4 count is more prone to ailments as the body's defence mechanism starts giving way. The ART for HIV patients is started only after the CD4 count falls below 250.After administering the ayurvedic drug, the doctors found that the CD4 count in patients on an average went up from 448 to 546 within six months and up to 590 in a year's time. Besides, many patients had weight gains, increase in haemoglobin count and a sense of well-being.Claiming that it spells a lot of promise, head of medicine at KEM Hospital Dr A R Pazare said that not every patient who tests positive for HIV immediately qualifies for the ART drugs. ""Till a patient's CD4 count comes down to 250, we cannot prescribe ART. But patients show apprehension to go back home without medicines, especially after they are found positive for such a dreaded ailment,'' he said. Moreover, ART has side-effects like pain in abdomen, weakening of limbs and arms, swollen abdomen and distortion of facial features.Therefore, Pazare believes that patients could be prescribed some ayurvedic drugs with immuno-restorative properties that can delay the initiation of ART. ""Our assumption is that ayurvedic drugs with properties to strengthen immunity can delay the ART therapy by at least four years,'' said Pazare. ""And later, as the patient is put on ART, he can survive for a few more decades,'' he added. The KEM hospital study will be on for the next five years.However, the study solely focused on CD4 cells and did not check if the drug could bring down the viral load in a patient. Another hitch remains that ayurvedic drugs cannot be consumed simultaneously with the ART drugs.Speaking on the use of alternative therapies, head of ART department of JJ Hospital Dr Alaka Deshpande said nations across the globe were looking for indigenous medicines for HIV. ""Even in India, more systematic studies are required as there is no standardised data that talks about long-term effects,'' she said. Yet, she added that it may not be a bad idea to put patients on ayurvedic medicines with proven benefits till they are ideal candidates for ART.","['hospital', 'hiv', 'cd4', 'positive', 'hope', 'ayurvedic', 'patients', 'drugs', 'count', 'cells', 'ayurveda', 'art']","MUMBAI: With no cure in sight for the dreaded HIV, scientists across the globe are working towards drugs to prolong the life-span of afflicted patients.

In 1995, he applied for a work visa, forking out Rs 20,000 to an agent in Mumbai. A mandatory medical check followed and all the doctor would tell him was that ""something is wrong"" with his blood test results. He offered however to help suppress information for a ""commission"" of Rs 2,000.The expenses cost Harjeet a loan but he managed to fly to Saudi Arabia. On arrival, he was subjected to another medical test. To his shock, he was soon after whisked away to an isolated cell and jailed there for a day. The next day he was taken to a court which ordered his deportation. Harjeet, it seems, had tested HIV-positive .Back in India, Harjeet found that his wife had walked out of the family home with their two children. He was packed off to a care centre and left alone to deal with his situation. Severely depressed, Harjeet began getting multiple seizures that left him partially paralysed . He eventually recovered with a lot of support from the care centre. Today, Harjeet works with people who are HIV-positive and his life story has been documented by the International Aids Society (IAS).Harjeet is not alone. Thousands of people across the world have been deported or denied entry into countries because they are HIV-positive . This is despite the fact that stigmatising HIV-positive individuals is contrary to effective public health programming.Official data shows that 66 countries, territories and areas deny entry, stay or residence to HIV-positive individuals: of these, 26 deport migrants who test positive, seven refuse permission to stay beyond a certain time bar and six deny entry even for very short-term stay.""It is incomprehensible that HIV-related entry and residency restrictions still exist,"" says Kevin Moody, International Coordinator and CEO, Global Network of People Living with HIV. ""These restrictions are in blatant violation of human rights, they stimulate stigma and discrimination and actually hurt the response to the HIV epidemic.""India's health secretary, K Sujatha Rao, believes that irrational discriminatory laws should be lifted. ""In India, we don't have any laws against residence or visit by HIV patient,"" she points out.Many of these restrictions, says the IAS, were imposed in the early days of the epidemic, when there was a great deal of ignorance, fear and prejudice surrounding the subject. At that time, many governments saw these laws as an attempt to ""protect the public health"" and avoid the potential costs of care.The situation has, however, changed dramatically. There is a lot of information available about the disease and its prevention and the antiretroviral treatment can extend the life span of those who are HIV positive. Dr Helene Gayle, chief advisor to US president Barack Obama on HIV/AIDS , points out that these restrictive laws are no longer justified by concerns about public health.""Over 60 countries around the world have a variety of HIV-specific laws that restrict the entry, stay or residence of people living with HIV including Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Qatar, Oman, Russia, Colombia , South Korea, Yemen and Armenia ,"" says Dr Gayle. According to IAS executive director Craig McClure, scientific evidence shows that travel restrictions against those who are HIV-infected make for ineffective prevention tools. ""These laws are not consistent with current scientific knowledge, best practices in public health and humanitarian principles. They sustain a culture of exclusion, rights violations and marginalisation that impedes an effective response to the epidemic,"" says McClure.A WHO statement points out that such entry restrictions actually pressurise people into concealing their HIV infection from immigration authorities. They simply do not carry their HIV medicines on international trips. This could lead to drug-resistant HIV strains that are transmissible to other people. ""Furthermore, because drug resistance allows HIV to replicate in the body more freely, people with higher viral loads are also more infectious,"" says the statement.In the Asia and the Pacific region, countries have different kinds of restrictive laws for the HIV-affected . Singapore has an outright ban on all HIV-positive non-nationals for entry and immigration.Brunei targets HIV-positive foreigners for deportation. Australia requires HIV testing for permanent visa applicants over the age of 15. South Korea announced changes to its entry and immigration policy on January 1, 2010, but clarifications on its amended laws are still unclear.Some countries ask applicants to indicate their HIV status, some seek confirmation of HIV-negative test results and others insist on testing as a part of a mandatory medical exam for those seeking work permits.Things are however changing. The US, China and Namibia recently lifted their decades old travel laws against HIV-positive people. Hopefully, others will follow suit,and soon.","['hiv', 'laws', 'restrictions', 'hivpositive', 'test', 'harjeet', 'public', 'health', 'countries', 'positively', 'unwelcome', 'victims', 'entry']","Thousands of people across the world have been deported or denied entry into countries because they are HIV-positive .

With no medical treatment or hope of life, HIV positive children had little to look forward to. But more than two decades after the deadly disease was first detected in Chennai, several babies now have a chance of survival into adulthood thanks to medical regimen and better nutrition.When the Indian government began the national Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) for HIV patients in 2004, the programme was a godsend to many infected patients who had even given up on the idea of survival. ""Before the ART programme began, morbidity and mortality rate for HIV positive patients were high,"" says Dr P Manorama, chairperson of the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), who runs a home for HIV positive children in Chennai. Today, mortality levels have significantly reduced, from 13 % in 2005 to 8 % in 2010, according to the Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TANSACS).But all the medical and financial aid given by the government is not enough to offset the need for emotional support for the patients, especially children infected with HIV. According to statistics furnished by TANSACS, there are 11,197 children living with HIV in the state today and a sizeable number among them are adolescents.Daisy David of World Vision, an NGO working with HIV positive teenagers, says there is a large segment of children born with the disease, who have today reached their adolescence. ""Children living with HIV have the same exposure to society and media as other children,"" she points out. ""They too grow up with ambitions and desires. However, the discussions provided by the government are inadequate. They not only need counseling on career ambitions and how to battle life on the professional front, but also on the changes their bodies undergo and their own desires regarding sex, marriage and companionship.""Counselling HIV teenagers about marriage and companionship is rather difficult. ""There is need for counsellors who are equipped to handle all kinds of issues and emotions,"" says Dr.Lakshmibai, project director for Tamil Nadu Aids Initiative (TAI).""Many of them would like to marry non-infected persons, so there is always the issue of acceptance and rejection,"" says Daisy, who had recently attended a workshop for HIV-infected adolescents in Manipur. ""At Manipur, I met a teenaged boy who was battling rejection after his girlfriend found out he was HIV positive. They all had questions as to whether they could have sexual intercourse with non-infected persons, whether the babies born out of such a bonding would also be infected.

And, Varanasi is supposed to be one of the main centres of HIV infected persons due to its migrant population.""In Varanasi district alone, there are over 1,000 persons infected with HIV and the number of such people goes above 11,000 in eastern parts of UP,"" informed secretary, Banaras Network of Positive People Living with HIV/AIDS Society (commonly known as BNP+), Sunil Seth. The network is spread over 30 districts of the state with active members to motivate and help HIV persons to lead a purposeful life.However, according to WHO report, over 34 million people are living with HIV and AIDS across the world. India alone, with 2.3 million cases of HIV, has the third highest number of HIV affected persons in the world.According to the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), around 3,22,521 persons were taking treatment for AIDS by April 2010. And, to give a new lease of life to such persons, the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre at the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) is playing a remarkable role. ""So far, 11,321 HIV patients have been registered with the ART Centre, Institute of Medical Sciences , BHU,"" said Dr Jaya of the centre. ""Around 4,500 patients are living on therapy and get regular medicines,"" she added. The ART at BHU is one of the 10 centres of excellence in HIV care in the country and the only in Uttar Pradesh, where the facility of second line drugs is available. It monitors the activity of 11 ART centres in Bihar, UP and Madhya Pradesh. It is also a training and research centre.According to the doctor, those patients registered in ART centre of BHU, who have completed six month's therapy and are stable and have increasing CD4 count, can be referred to Link ART centres affiliated to BHU ART centre established in the neighbouring districts of Ballia, Ghazipur, Jaunpur, Mau, Sonebhadra, Bhadohi, Chandauli and Azamgarh. They are basically drug distribution centres. Beside the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) and Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission (PPTCT) centre, Shiv Prasad Gupta District Hospital Kabirchoura, Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Regional Hospital Pandeypur and Central Jail Hospital Sivpur are other centres where free HIV investigation is available under NACO supervision.The crux of the whole exercise is to protect precious human life. The doctor says if by mistake one deviates and acquires this disease, he should not lose courage. He should get investigated and should take proper medicine and advice from the health personnel. An early diagnosis of HIV status helps in preventing and significantly delaying morbid conditions associated with HIV/AIDS. If the HIV-infected person is irregular in time or quantity of the drugs, or he starts and stops the drugs abruptly, the treatment becomes ineffective. The HIV infected person can live a productive and healthy life if he takes care of his health, eating habits and lifestyle.Vital FactsWhat is HIV?Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a virus, which damages the body's immune system by destroying CD4+lymphocutes. This CD4 cells help us to fight against infections. Thus destruction of these cells by the virus leads to immune deficiency and susceptibility to different infections.How it spreadsHIV infection spreads through unsafe sexual contact, transfusion of infected blood or blood products, sharing needles to inject drugs and from mother to child during childbirth and breast-feeding. However, HIV does not spread through mosquito bites, tear, saliva, urine, by embracing, casual kissing, hand shaking, working together, taking bath or swimming together with HIV infected person.In India, it is migrant population, truck drivers, community sex workers and IV drug abusers who are affected. They, in turn, spread the disease to their wives, children and clients.Clinical presentationWithin a few weeks of being infected, some people get fever, headache, sore muscles and joints, stomach ache, swollen lymph glands or a skin rash for one or two weeks. Most people think it is flu. After the initial illness, patients can remain symptom free for many years (3-10 years), as the CD4 cell count decreases and the immunity decreases the patient first gets minor infection then the severity of infection increases. The last stage of HIV infection is when the CD4 decreases below 200 per micro litre is called AIDS when the patient may succumb to minor illness.How to get testedIf any person wants to get himself tested for HIV, he should go to the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) which provides free testing and counselling. The ICTC centres are present in every district hospital and medical colleges. If a person tests positive, he is referred to the nearest anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre.TreatmentOnce a person is infected with HIV virus, the virus can never be eliminated from the body. However, there are drugs available that can suppress the level of virus in the body. These drugs are available free of cost at all ART centres. Every HIV positive patient may not be started on treatment immediately. The treatment is started on the basis of CD4 count and stage of the disease. The treatment, if started, has to be continued lifelong. It is extremely important to adhere to the treatment so as to prevent failure of the drug regimen.Where to go for treatmentThe National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) control programme in India through 35 HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Societies and 269 ART centres throughout the country.

Be that as it may, 2.6 lakh people are still in dire need of ART.According to the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) latest report, “Towards Universal Access”, which tracks progress in achieving the 2010 target for HIV prevention, treatment and care; around 5.8 lakh HIV patients required ART in end-2009.Globally, the HIV epidemic continued to be a real public health challenge as around 33.4 million people are suffering from the lethal disease. In 2008 alone, 2.7 million people were newly infected with the virus.According to the report, only one-third of HIV patients have been put on ART, and coverage of prevention interventions is largely inadequate.This year, WHO’s revised guidelines on ART for adults and adolescents, including would-be mothers, said ART would be initiated when CD4 cell counts reach or drop below 350 cells/mm3, irrespective of whether the patients have clinical symptoms. As per this count, though an estimated 11 -14 lakh HIV patients in India need ART, only 23% are receiving the treatment.The number of pregnant women, who require ART, is pegged at 43,000. But only 21% are covered. Another 30,000-76,000 HIV positive children, too, require ART.However, there has been a spurt in the number of HIV tests across the world. For instance, 100 countries had tested 67 million people last year.In 82 countries — for which comparable data was available for 2008 and 2009 — the median number of tests performed per 1,000 people had increased from 41 to 50, respectively. ART coverage, among young adults less than 15 years, has gone up from 22% in 2008 to 28% in 2009.Even the percentage of HIV positive pregnant women receiving ART to prevent mother-to-child transmission has increased from 45% in 2008 to 53% in 2009. In end-2009, 5.25 million people were receiving ART in low and middle-income countries, including India, which translates to an increase of over 1.2 million people from the previous year.The report maintains that HIV-related TB remains a cause for concern. In 2008, of the 9.4 million TB cases reported worldwide, an estimated 1.4 million were diagnosed among HIV patients.

The period between April to August this year alone saw the number touch the 239 mark. Also, HIV accounts for 30 per cent of the average 100-120 prison deaths each year in the state.More alarming is the fact that these figures are only approximate. For, there is no mandatory HIV screening of prisoners at the time of admission and thus officials admit that they are not aware of HIV status of many inmates in various state prisons. “Some persons consider HIV tests to be taboo and do not give their consent to be screened. Even though they belong to the high risk group, their status remains unknown,” said R V Chandravadan, project director of AP state AIDS control society (APSACS).With rampant instances of men having sex with men (MSM) once they are secluded from mainstream society and confined to their barracks, this figure is a fair indicator of the vulnerability of other prisoners, which is now manifest in the form of diseases.“A large number of them are presently suffering from genital ulcer disease (GUD) which results from having unnatural forms of sex. Once diagnosed with such diseases, they become ten times more susceptible to acquiring AIDS at a later date,” said a medical practitioner who recently visited and interacted with medical officers of two central prisons in the state.With APSACS having introduced its ‘Raksha’ project in state prisons in February last year as part of which prisoners are screened and those carrying the HIV infection sent for treatment, the mechanism is presently in place. But no decision has been taken yet by the prison authorities to keep a check on the HIV positive count once APSACS concludes its intervention programme next year.“Habitual offenders who keep coming back to prison for petty crimes often indulge in unsafe sex outside and have multiple partners thus posing a threat to other inmates,’’ said a prison superintendent.","['hiv', 'positive', 'having', 'prison', 'numbers', 'prisons', 'number', 'sex', 'bars', 'various', 'state', 'prisoners', 'rise']","HYDERABAD: State prisons are turning into HIV hubs with a three-fold rise in the number of fresh HIV cases detected in various prisons this year.Figures collated by a state government body which works closely with HIV positive persons throws up the alarming fact: as against the 119 prisoner from across the state who tested positive for HIV in 2009, the count this year has touched 362 as on date.

A special emphasis during the discussion was on gender norms. The researchers emphasised the need to produce greater gender equality and to shift norms that place aggression, violence and sexual exploitation within the masculine domain and are aggravated under the influence of alcohol.Ongoing research in different countries suggests that women’s risk of gender-based and sexual violence is also increased by their partner’s alcohol consumption. Therefore, without addressing gender issues, efforts to reduce alcohol-related sexual-risk behaviour might only be partly successful.Speaking at the conference, Dr Ravi Verma , regional director, International Center for Research on Women (ICRW), said, “Gender is missing from many alcohol related as well as HIV related interventions. Interventions of any kind in the development sector must be conscientious of gender.

A special emphasis during the discussion was on gender norms.
Therefore, without addressing gender issues, efforts to reduce alcohol-related sexual-risk behaviour might only be partly successful.Speaking at the conference, Dr Ravi Verma , regional director, International Center for Research on Women (ICRW), said, “Gender is missing from many alcohol related as well as HIV related interventions.

To prevent this transmission, the State Aids Control Society (SACS), Chandigarh, has started providing free milk powder to the HIV-positive mothers until the child is six months. It is expected to benefit around 100 such women. Out of the 1,176 registered positives in the city, 200 are women of reproductive age.SACS director Dr Vanita Gupta says, “Breastfeeding can transmit the virus to a child. We advise continuity of whatever milk a child is on. In case, a positive mother is unable to continue feeding the infant before it turns six months and makes it drink processed one, it develops infection.”“The mothers need not bother about how to sustain the life of their young one as the free supply will continue until the baby turns six months. At the time of anti-retroviral therapy, we screen out expectant mothers who can avail this scheme from their nearest integrated counselling and testing centres,?”she adds.The SACS has roped in a few NGOs to manage finances for the purpose. It is only after a doctor clinically decides the criteria of which patient can breastfeed, the milk tin is given, states Dr Archana Mohan of SACS.HIV can spread from a mother to her infant during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding. When milk powder feed is followed by breastfeed, the lining of the baby’s intestine is destroyed. This makes it susceptible to HIV, warns Dr Vanita.Most of the positives are unable to afford this nutrient. The virus disables them to work and earn livelihood. This small initiative can make some difference for them.

This major policy shift was finalised by NACO on Thursday night.Till now, NACO only provided second line treatment to those HIV patients who were part of its ART centres and had become resistant to first line drugs. Those patients on first line treatment in private hospitals or clinics were not eligible.Second line treatment is tremendously expensive and not affordable for the common man. Also, it was only available in NACO's ART centres. So, patients who did not get first line treatment in NACO's ART centres perished if they became resistant.Solicitor general Gopal Subramaniam informed a Supreme Court Bench comprising Chief Justice S H Kapadia, Justices K S Radhakrishnan and Swatanter Kumar that the health ministry took this decision on Friday. He informed the SC that details of the decision would be intimated through an affidavit in two weeks.So what happens to those who were put on first line ART post-2004 but have become resistant to first line drugs? Expert committees in the 10 centres of excellence presently in charge of giving second line treatment will take a call.ART is the only known treatment that inhibits HIV. The drugs slow down the replication of HIV and immune deterioration is delayed leading to an improvement in the survival and quality of life.While first line drugs cost NACO Rs 5,000 per patient per year, second line cost them Rs 35,000 per patient per year. Patients, however, get the treatment free of charge.India is home to an estimated 2.3 million HIV patients of which 6 lakh would require to be on ART. At present, 3.55 lakh HIV patients are receiving first line treatment in 285 NACO ART centres.Ten centres have rolled out second line ART to 1,701 HIV patients. Five more centres in Nagpur, Pune, Salem, Aurangabad and Surat have been trained to start second line ART while two centres in Vijayawada and Hubli are being prepared.India rolled out second line ART for the first time on December 1, 2008 in Mumbai's J J Hospital and Chennai's Tambaram ART centre.Resistance to first line treatment mainly happens because of poor adherence to the treatment regimen. If not put on second line immediately, most of these patients die within a few years.A CD-4 count test is used to gauge immunity levels of an HIV-infected patient and to assess whether damage caused by the virus requires life-saving ART. The CD-4 count in healthy adults ranges from 500 to 1,500 cells per cubic millimetre of blood. In HIV infected people, it goes down by 60 cells per cubic millimetre of blood per year as HIV progresses.

Of these, 83 children are healthy and free from HIV infection. One baby died due to early infection.Head of the gynaecology department Dr Suneeta Mittal said 61% of these children were delivered through caesarean procedure as it reduces the chances of infection transmission by one-third. The rest were born through normal delivery. ""We screened more than 10,000 pregnant women admitted at AIIMS under `Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission' programme. Of these, 128 women tested positive for the disease. Fifteen percent opted for termination of the pregnancy while others were operated on and given the required drugs,'' Mittal said.Lalit Kumar, a counsellor at AIIMS, said that 75% of the HIV positive mothers treated by the departments were from the cities, including Delhi. ""There were some cases in which the women were found positive for HIV and the male counterpart tested negative. This led to tension in the family and their relationship was on the verge of breaking. But after the birth of the child, the family was happy,'' said Kumar.The treatment included doses of Nevarapin to the mother during delivery, followed by a single dose to the infant within 72 hours of birth. Except for one child who died within hours of birth as he was infected before the mother reached us, all children are safe and have tested negative for HIV, said Dr Mittal.Out of 84 children born, 47 have completed their periodical tests of 18 months and have tested negative for the infection. ""These children can live a healthy life now. We hope good results for other children too,'' said Dr Mittal. She said that breast feeding can also lead to transmission of HIV infection, so most of the mothers have been advised against it.According to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), every year, more than 7 lakh children become HIV-positive via transmission from their parents across the world.

77,2-12-2010,['Malathy Iyer'],https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg,"MUMBAI: In tune with the global trend, the HIV/AIDS epidemic appears to be slowing down in Mumbai as well. For decades the city was infamous for being the HIV capital of India, but figures available with the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society show that for the third consecutive year the HIV incidence is falling.If 5,420 AIDS cases were registered in 2007, there were only 2,942 cases in 2008 and 1,308 cases in 2009. ""So far this year, we have registered 966 cases,"" said MDACS chief Dr S S Kudalkar, adding that the epidemic is clearly on the wane.The city has many reasons to cheer on the HIV/AIDS front. Many of the indicators that are used to assess the epidemic's spread in the general population show a downward trend. The virus is lower than ever before among pregnant women, dipping from 1.24% in 2005 to 0.53% in the first 10 months of 2010. Public health experts say this unsuspecting segment provides the best indicator of the disease's presence in the general population.People who queue up voluntarily to donate blood provide another indicator of HIV's presence in the society: seropositivity has fallen from 1.06% in 2002 to 0.46% in 2009. In the period up to October 2010, only 903 from 2,19,332 donors tested positive for HIV. ""This means only 0.41% were positive,"" said Kudalkar.But the statistic that the MDACS director is most pleased about is the dipping number of deaths among HIV-positive people whose disease progressed to full-blown AIDS. At the height of the AIDS epidemic, say in 2004, the death rate stood at 8.67% among the 3,205 AIDS patients identified that year. This year, the rate has fallen to 3.7%—that is, 36 deaths among 966 patients. ""It is obvious that with better availability of ART ( anti-retro viral therapy ), patients are leading healthier and longer lives than before,"" said Kudalkar.The downward trend in Mumbai is not surprising as the recently released United Nations AIDS organization's figures show. Globally, HIV infection rates have fallen by nearly 20% in the last 10 years to 2.6 million in 2009 from 3.1 million in 1999.

It said such persons were either switched to second line treatment at an early stage or were put directly on second line drugs without undergoing the preliminary treatment, thus making them hard cases.NACO's attempt to broadbase its second line treatment by excluding those who had little hope of surviving for long was, prima facie, unpalatable to a Bench of Chief Justice S H Kapadia and Justices K S Radhakrishnan and Swatanter Kumar, which was hearing a PIL filed by NGO Sankalp Rehabilitation Trust.""We cannot go by this discrimination.

Though there is a programme and facilities to control HIV/AIDS, most of them felt themselves excluded from the society.It was an initiative of the Uttar Pradesh Welfare for People Living with HIV/AIDS (UPNP+) with the support of UNICEF and Media Nest to give a voice to such persons and create awareness among people.

However, there are now 33.4 million people living with HIV, according to 2008 figures released by WHO. An estimated 2.7 million were newly infected with the virus and 2 million died of AIDS the same year.

With no treatment available for it, prevention is the only way to control AIDS cases. Add to this social stigma, ostracism and multiple legal issues, AIDS gets more complex, specially in countries like India.HIV the etiological agent of AIDS belongs to the Lentivirus subgroup of the family retroviridae. It is a challenging issue across the world. The virus is present in blood, tissue and all body fluid of infected persons. HIV is spread by sexual contact with infected persons (heterosexual or homosexual), by blood and blood products, and from infected mother to babies.About 85% AIDS cases are due to sexual contact 3.80%, 2.05%, 3.34% and 6.46% due to prenatal transmission, blood transfusion, injecting durg users and others respectively.The World AIDS Day is being observed since December 1, 1988, and aims at raising money, increasing awareness, fighting prejudice and improving education. The theme for this year is ""Universal access and human rights"". World AIDS Day reminds people that HIV still exists and a lot still needs to be done.Head, department of forensic medicine, MLN Medical College , Dr US Sinha says, ""In a study conducted by our department in 2009-10 shows that 75% men and 25% women came for HIV tests here. Out of these, 18.6% men and 12% women were found HIV positive. The maximum HIV+ cases were in the age group of 25-34 years.As far as distribution of persons suffering from psychosomatic disorder is concerned, over 94% people express shock, stigmatisation (76%), discrimination (70%), family violence (47%), social violence (31%), family rejection (41%), social rejection (64%), depression (88%), loneliness (76%), fear (100%) and suicidal tendency (58%).Dr Sinha says as the incidence and public awareness of required immunodeficiency syndrome increases, the ethical, legal and regulatory mechanism too are becoming significant.In August 1989, the AIDS Prevention Bill was moved in Parliament. The section 4 of the bill mandates every registered physician to report each case of HIV positive patient to health authorities, but does not provide a confidentially clause.Section 7 of the Bill however, requires health authorities to undertake counselling, health education and specialised treatment.

Yerawada Central Jail in Pune has 120 HIV infected inmates, the highest in the state.""A total 21,404 prisoners in Maharashtra's prisons were screened in the last two years. Of them, 4,472 inmates were from Yerawada Central Jail. Among them, 120 were detected with HIV infection which is the highest in the state,"" said Dilip Deshmukh , additional project director of the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) told TOI on MondayOf the 467 HIV infected prisoners, 87 have been put on antiretroviral treatment as their CD4 count is less than 250, said Deshmukh.CD4 cells are specialised cells that protect the body. HIV attacks these cells and uses them to spread the virus which weakens the immune system.People without HIV infection have about 700 to 1000 CD4 cells in a drop of blood. HIV infected people are considered to have normal CD4 counts if the number is above 500 CD4 cells in on blood drop.Health experts say that prisoners can be HIV infected if they participate in unprotected sex or share infected needles while using illicit drugs.They also maintained that the HIV infection rate among prisoners was lower than the general populace that came for testing to integrated counselling and treatment centres at hospitals.""The prevalence rate comes to 2.18 per cent of the total number of prisoners which is below the 4.7 per cent incidence rate in the general population coming to ICTCs for testing,"" said Deshmukh.""The presence of HIV infected persons and those at high risk in prisons is a critical challenge. Unlike the general population, many prisoners may not be aware if they are infected with HIV. Often, vastly crowded living conditions lead to such behaviour among prisoners,"" said A L Kakrani, professor and head department of medicine D Y Patil Medical College. He is also an ex-member of the technical resource group of the Government of India on ART.""The tedious prison environment, lack of occupation of mind and body and plain boredom lead to accumulated frustration and tension. This environment leads to the high-risk activities such as use of drugs and unprotected sex between men,"" Kakrani said.The history of five HIV infected inmates at Yerawada jail has revealed that they were MSM (men having sex with men), said Sudhakar Ingale, counsellor of the ICTC centre at the jail. ""We are spreading awareness about the risks associated with MSM among the prisoners,"" he said.A recent UNAIDS report says that the HIV epidemic in Asia was concentrated largely among people who inject drugs, sex workers (FSW) and their clients, and MSMs. About 90 per cent of those newly infected with HIV in India were believed to have acquired it during unprotected sex.The ICTC facilitiesThe Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) facilities were started at Yerawada and Amravati jails by the MSACS as a pilot project on October 2, 2008 . The move came following a directive by the Bombay High Court.The ICTC facilities with full-time counsellors and technicians have been started at five more jails including Nashik, Taloja, Kolhapur, Aurangabad and Nagpur. The other jails in the state send the inmates for testing and counselling to government hospitals that have ICTC facilities.""There are no plans to set up full-fledged ICTCs in all the prisons in the state. Earlier, a proposal was sent to the National AIDS Control Society of India (NACO), but they are ready to extend only training if the state government recruits workforce,"" said Deshmukh.An integrated counselling and testing centre is a place where a person is counselled and tested for HIV, on his own free will or as advised by a medical practitioner. The main functions of an ICTC include counselling and testing for HIV, creating awareness on modes of transmission, prevention of HIV/AIDS for promoting behavioural change and reducing vulnerability.","['hiv', 'ictc', 'prisons', 'testing', 'counselling', 'infected', 'yerawada', 'tops', 'cells', '120', 'inmates', 'state', 'prisoners']","Yerawada Central Jail in Pune has 120 HIV infected inmates, the highest in the state.

The children, aged between three and 12 years, were denied admission to a prominent school in Gurgaon last year on ‘medical grounds’ and even the government school they have been shifted to is threatening to remove them as they are HIV positive . The NGO looking after them has alleged that the kids are treated poorly at their school and are mocked at by fellow children.“The students call us ‘bimari’. Even the teachers do not help. They often scold us and make us work,” said 12-year-old Amit (name changed), who studies in Class VI at Rajkiya Vidyalaya in Bhondsi, Haryana. Another 11-year-old child, who has no memories of his parents or where he was born, says teachers discriminate against him. “They make us clean the classroom, do gardening work and often scold us. They ask us why we keep taking medicines and beat us up if we protest,” he alleged, adding that he has no illness and is healthy like any other child.According to Sunita Gupta, chairperson of NGO Drone Foundation which looks after these children, the teacher in-charge of the government-run school has warned of action if a medical certificate is not produced at the earliest. “The children feel scared to go to school. I met the principal some days ago and he threatened disciplinary action as the school was not informed about the fact that these children were HIV positive. They are being harassed,” she claimed. Gupta added that the children, who were orphaned, were first registered under the education program for underprivileged children run by DPS Maruti Kunj in March 2009. “Though the school administration was supportive in the beginning, due to pressure from parents of other children and teachers, they asked us to make alternate arrangement for their education in August. One academic year was lost as all other schools had closed admissions by then,” she said.When contacted, principal of DPS Maruti Kunj Rachna Pandit said that the children were never admitted to the school. “Such children need special care. We talked to doctors and experts about their emergency needs and care, and finally decided to drop them as we do not have expertise in dealing with such cases.

Their further attempt to deny employment to them is again not only unwarranted but also contrary to the dictum laid down by various courts and the policy of the Union of India .""The matter relates to two candidates — identified merely as ‘Mr X’ and ‘Mr Y’ — who were sponsored by the employment exchange for driver posts.While Mr Y had passed plus two, Mr X had served in the Army for eight years.In October 2009 and November 2009, they were considered for appointment and sent to panel doctors for the medical fitness certificate. After their blood samples tested HIV positive, the doctors said they were ‘unfit’ for appointment as drivers.Interestingly, the blood test was not conducted in any specialised laboratory; neither was it done with the consent of the candidates. Also, no prior information or pre-test and post-test counselling was provided by the laboratory. Without heeding to requests, the doctors forwarded the ‘report’ to the transport corporations with findings that they were unfit for employment.Responding to the writ petition, the managements contended that the candidates were HIV-positive and hence not of sound health. There was no fundamental right guaranteed in the Constitution for being selected as driver, it was further submitted.Justice Chandru, expressing shock at the ""layman apprehension"" of the authorities, dubbed the incident unfortunate. He said the issue had already been answered by court decisions all over the world, including the Supreme Court of India. Quoting extensively from judgments in the US and South Africa and other courts in India, Justice Chandru pointed out that the guiding principles of India’s national policy on HIV/AIDS was non-discrimination.Noting that a test for CD4 count dropping below 350 cells per microlitre of blood alone could be the scientific basis for turning down candidates, he said, ""This is the standard test adopted by the Indian Army.""

India is now working on rolling out Red Ribbon buses that would reach out to the most backward villagers — targets that the chugging train missed out while passing through 22 states and 152 districts in one year.Speaking exclusively to ToI, Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said though the train was first introduced in India in 2007, it was primarily used for creating awareness against HIV.In 2010, the ministry decided to use the train to test people for HIV. Doctors, posted on the train and at stations, counselled the patients.""The train reached out to eight million people, trained 81,000 and tested 36,000 for HIV. I have asked National Aids Control Organisation (Naco) to identify specific high prevalence districts, where we will send Red Ribbon buses to provide treatment, counselling and talk about safe sex. The buses will have testing and treatment facilities on board,"" Azad said.Naco is close to identifying around 35 high prevalence districts in six states — West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Orissa, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh — where the Red Ribbon buses will be rolled out by April.A bus, a testing and treatment mobile unit with two doctors and four counsellors will be dedicated for three districts. ""Those being targetted are from backward districts, which the train couldn't reach. Our idea is to contain the virus in small pockets and not let it spread,"" the minister added. The targetted districts are known to be hotspots for migrants to urban areas.""The buses and medical unit will teach migrants about safe sex habits and precautions. They will also be encouraged to get tested for HIV before leaving the village and after returning from the city,"" a Naco official said.Around 1.2 lakh Indians got infected with HIV in 2010, even though the incidence rate of new cases fell in the country by over 50% in the last decade. India, which has 2.4 million HIV patients, ranks third after South Africa and Nigeria. However, the country's HIV prevalence is still low at 0.31% from 0.36% in 2006.Migrants are believed to be fuelling India's HIV epidemic. This has led Naco to identify 68 main railway stations in districts across 11 states from where migrants usually board long-distance trains for urban areas.Studies on the relation between migration and HIV conducted recently by Naco in three popular migration corridors — Ganjam-Surat, Darbhanga-Delhi and Azamgarh-Mumbai — threw up shocking findings. The highest burden of HIV was found to be among migrants, after the high-risk groups like sex workers and men who have sex with men.According to the 2001 census, 30.1% of the population was considered to have migrated (314 million) — a considerable increase from 27.4% in 1991.","['hiv', 'districts', 'ribbon', 'red', 'sex', 'naco', 'train', 'migrants', 'backward', 'spread', 'buses', 'awareness', 'treatment']","NEW DELHI: Remember the Red Ribbon Express — the eight-coach train that covered 25,000 km spreading awareness about HIV .

A new method, using filter paper, allows high-end polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to be performed equally effectively on small spots of dried blood rather than a whole blood sample with equal amount of sensitivity and specificity.A pilot project using this method has been successfully implemented at seven paediatric referral centres across the country by the National AIDS Control Organisation ( NACO ) in which a total of 9,000 samples of children, including infants, exposed to the HIV infection, were successfully screened under Early infant HIV diagnosis (EID) programme.“The PCR is a high-end test which is used to diagnose babies born to HIV-positive mothers. Traditionally, the test requires a liquid blood sample, which if taken in a rural area and transported to a testing facility, needs to be kept refrigerated. However, the dried blood spots (DBS) method is easy to prepare in a resource-limited setting and can be stored and shipped to testing facilities without refrigeration. The method has been tested successfully at the seven referral centres,” said Sayan Chatterjee, director-general of NACO, on Thursday.The PCR test using DBS method has proven to be as effective as the PCR using liquid blood samples, with good amount of sensitivity and specificity, he added. The city-based National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) and the B J medical college are among the seven referral centres where the samples were tested with the help of this newer diagnosis method in the last one year.“Out of the 9,000 children, 460 were found to be HIV-positive. In order to reconfirm the results, tests were also conducted on the whole blood samples to substantiate the findings,” said B B Rewari, NACO’s national programme officer. If not treated, an HIV-positive child has a 35 per cent chance of dying by his/her first birthday and a 53 per cent chance of dying before the age of two. But if the baby receives prophylactic antibiotics soon after birth and antiretroviral therapy (ART) as soon as it is medically indicated, he/she has a good chance of surviving childhood and living a long, healthy life.“The challenge in resource-limited settings is identifying HIV-positive infants and providing early access to this life-saving medicine,” Rewari said. The National AIDS Control Organisation has now formulated technical and operational guidelines on care of HIV-exposed infants and children below 18 months of age.The 2010 World Health Organisation guidelines recommend that all HIV-positive infants, under two years of age, begin antiretroviral treatment regardless of CD4 count or disease stage. Without antiretroviral treatment, an estimated 50 per cent of the children with HIV will die before the age of two. HIV DNA testing is necessary to make a definitive diagnosis in children below 18 months because of the persistence of maternal antibodies until this age.","['hiv', 'children', 'blood', 'hivpositive', 'pcr', 'samples', 'effective', 'test', 'method', 'diagnosing', 'infants', 'using']","PUNE: Diagnosing HIV in infants and children has taken a giant leap forward.

The move is expected to bring in better quality of living and help avert co-infections among the HIV infected.“The current evidence in HIV management suggests that antiretroviral therapy should be recommended to those with HIV whose CD4 cell counts are below 350 cells/mm3, from the current threshold which is 250,” said Sayan Chatterje, director-general of National AIDS Control Organisation ( NACO ). He was in the city to attend the three-day consultative meeting on ‘Galvanising Evidence for HIV Management’ that started at the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) in Bhosari on Thursday.There is widespread consensus that ART should be initiated when CD4 counts drop below 350, and this recommendation is supported by data from cohort studies and results from randomised control trials (RCT), he added. Standard antiretroviral therapy (ART) consists of the use of at least three anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs to suppress the HIV virus and stop its progress. “Huge reductions have been seen in rates of death and suffering when use is made of a potent anti-retroviral regimen,” Chatterjee said.B B Rewari, NACO’s national programme officer (ART), said, “The guidelines for administering ART which is at present given to HIV infected people with CD4 count less than 250 is all set to be revamped. It will be like the US once the cut-off level to get ART treatment is raised to 350 CD4 count.”An earlier start to antiretroviral treatment boosts the immune system and reduces the risks of HIV-related death and disease. It also lowers the risk of co-infection like tuberculosis, Rewari said. In 2006, WHO recommended that all patients start ART when their CD4 count (a measure of immune system strength) falls to 200 cells/mm3 or lower, at which point they typically show symptoms of disease. Since then, studies and trials have clearly demonstrated that starting ART earlier reduces rates of death and disease.WHO has now recommended that ART be initiated at a higher CD4 threshold of 350 cells/mm3 for all HIV-positive patients, including pregnant women, regardless of symptoms. “There is enough current evidence that suggest that the ART be initiated at a higher CD4 threshold of 350 cells/mm3. The recommendations churned out of this conference will serve to make policy decision in respect of the change in treatment guidelines,” said Nari’s director Ramesh Paranjape.","['hiv', 'cd4', 'antiretroviral', 'higher', 'count', 'cellsmm3', 'threshold', 'recommended', 'begin', '350', 'art', 'national', 'treatment', 'soon']","PUNE: The cut-off level to begin anti-retroviral treatment (ART) for people living with HIV (PLHIV) is set to be raised to 350 CD4 count from the existing 250.

Saturday’s delivery takes JJ’s tally of childbirths by HIV-positive women to 1,004 in the last 10 years.This is not an ordinary achievement for J J staffers as not many hospitals are willing to 0take up HIV-positive pregnancy cases. “Most of the HIV-positive pregnant women who come to us are either denied admission by hospitals or are referred to us,” said Dr Rekha Daver , head of obstetrics and gynaecology department at J J.The incidence of the babies born with HIV-positivity also has been low, claims the hospital. “We cannot say exactly how many babies were born HIV positive, as many mothers do not return to get their babies tested. But our estimation says that of all the HIV-positive deliveries, 5-10% of babies get the mother-to-child transfusion,” said Dr Daver, who is also the head of positive parent to child transfusion (PPTCT).The hospital has achieved the feat with the help of a certain medicine and delivery method. “According to the guidelines, we give nevrapin before the delivery. We prefer doing a normal delivery—one without making any incisions—to avoid mixing of the mother’s blood with the baby’s. Also, we give the mother the choice to breastfeed, even though there’s a slight chance of virus transmission,” added Dr Daver.Maharashtra District AIDS Control Society (MDACS), however, agrees that the load of conducting deliveries of HIV-positive women has largely fallen on public hospitals. “Public hospitals get majority of HIV-positive pregnant women as private hospitals do not want to do these deliveries. While the number of HIV-positive women directly coming to the public hospitals is high, those referred from private hospitals is equally high,” said Dr S S Kudalkar, project director of MDACS.Dr Y S Nandanwar, head of obstetrics and gynecology at Sion Hospital said that they may have assisted in 1,000 positive deliveries too. “We do not have the exact record, but the incidence of conducting an HIV-positive delivery is 1% in our hospital.

An antibody is an infection-fighting protein produced by our immune system when it detects harmful substances like viruses and bacteria.Scientists say these antibodies would ultimately reveal the Achilles heel of the virus. Studies have found that antibodies target a stable portion of the virus that does not frequently mutate - a defence mechanism that has till now helped the virus escape earlier developed experimental vaccines.Experts in this Indian lab will now look at new antibodies and how they bind to the virus. This will tell scientists which part of the virus to target with vaccines. The idea is to create artificially synthesized mimics of their targets on HIV, to be used in vaccines to elicit similar actions and teach the immune system how to thwart HIV infection.""With 7,100 people contracting HIV every day, effective tools to prevent infection are indispensable to the fight against HIV and AIDS. A broadly effective AIDS vaccine would be a powerful asset to efforts to arrest the spread of HIV,"" said M K Bhan , secretary of DBT.This collaborative programme will participate in a coordinated, global effort to create replicas of virus targets in the laboratory for use as immunogens, which are the active ingredients of vaccines. The programme will have the task of developing, testing and then implementing strategies to rapidly screen large numbers of immunogens against HIV-1 (dominant strain) and to prioritize them for further evaluation in preclinical studies.""We are very excited about the launch of this collaboration,"" said Seth Berkley , CEO of IAVI.Other institutions participating in this partnership include the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology in New Delhi and the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.Indians, too, are being screened for such effective HIV slaying antibodies. The country has its share of ""late progressors"" or ""elite controllers"" - people infected with HIV who stay healthy for years without requiring life-saving anti-retroviral treatment (ART). About one in 300 people with HIV is an elite controller.Meanwhile, another fascinating community - mainly comprising women - has also got scientists in India excited. Called ""exposed sero negative"" these are women who have, for years, had sex with HIV-positive, condom-refusing husbands, but never got infected. Many have also had babies who are not HIV-positive.Scientists are studying these elite controllers to see whether they carry special genes, which prevent the virus from multiplying in their bodies.

""Reports suggest that even foreign tourists are involved with the camel riders, specially when they opt for long camel safaris in the desert.

""We not only need to ensure that the community is made part of the mainstream, but also continue and scale our efforts to reach the unreached.""The convention was organised by Pathfinder International which has been implementing the Mukta project to reduce prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV/AIDS among the most at risk populations such as female sex workers (FSW), MSMs and their partners. Now working in five districts of Maharashtra, the project seeks to transition the management and implementation of the HIV programme to CBOs.The convention held at Panhala brought together around 300 community members from six districts of Maharashtra, namely Kolhapur, Latur, Nasik, Beed, Pune and Yavatmal where CBOs have been formed. Various groups and institutions working with the MSM community such as Samabhavana Society, Samapathik and Udaan also attended the convention. The event included guided discussions on strengthening communication for behaviour change, raising awareness on human rights, entitlements and imparting micro-planning, leadership and team-building skills.Sameer Kumta, from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that supports HIV prevention programmes in the districts, underlined the need for leadership from within the community and called upon the members to take ownership of the work and share responsibilities.""It is only through collective efforts that we can address newer challenges, while contributing effectively towards bringing down the HIV prevalence rates,"" he said, adding that the convention was a platform to rethink the communication, leadership and management strategies for a stronger community-led HIV response.Kumar (name changed) a Kolhapur-based peer educator, said, ""Coming together proved helpful in understanding how we can collectively address issues such as adherence to ART, consistent condom use, diagnosis and treatment of STIs, voluntary HIV testing, etc. We hope to carry home learnings from this workshop and use it to reach out to the community at our level.""

The double-storey house in Sector 6 of Malviya Nagar looks humble but it is a paradise for these impoverished children who themselves are carriers of the HIV and had faced social stigma after their parents succumbed to the deadly virus or abandoned them.When these children were found abandoned, Smriti Singh, who founded the AIDS care centre under the Faith Foundation, working for HIV positive orphans, adopted them.“They are my best friends. To see them grow healthier is my life’s aim,” the samaritan said.Smriti is among very few people in the city who came forward to help the HIV positive children. She is fondly called ‘Maa’ by these kids. Everyday, they ran towards the gate to receive her and she, too, doesn’t forget to bring chocolates for them.Most of the children aged between six and 16 years were found abandoned in various parts of the state. The latest inmate to join the care centre is eight-year-old Raghu. The pale and thin boy weighs only 12 kilos. He was found HIV positive after his mother was admitted to hospital in 2009. She died after a prolonged illness in 2010. His father left him alone as he left for work in Gujarat.“Most of them were subjected to discrimination in their respective areas. They were ill-treated by their close relatives after knowing their status,” Smriti said.The SMS Hospital, where they were brought initially for treatment, recommended these children to the care centre, which provided them food, shelter and treatment, apart from their schooling at a nearby institute.“In the school, they never face any problem. They mingle with other kids, play with them and exchange notes,” Smriti said.To make the children feel at home, she stuff the centre with toys, puzzles, pool table, cricket and badminton kits.The house has four rooms with each of them having colourful paintings and drawing by the children.A special study room with computers and general knowledge charts is also there where the children undergo many activities, including exercises, fun games and puzzles to sharpen their mind.On the children’s health, Smriti said, “These kids are prone to seasonal diseases and often require intense medication. Hence, I stocked all kinds of medicines in all corners of house.”Kausal, a volunteer at the foundation, said, “I monitor everyone during meals. These kids require nutritional food to help them grow and fight against diseases.”To make the life of these children exciting, the foundation plans to take them on a trip to Goa. “The kids are now very excited about their flight to Goa. Throughout the day, they make plans on how they will make most of the trip,” Kausal said.Also, volunteers both from India and abroad spend quality time with the children at the home during summer months or their pre-job breaks. “I share happiness and my time with them. It gives me immense pleasure to teach them English,” said Pauline Agache, a language student from Belgium, on her visit to the care home.The foundation generate funds by organising luncheons and dinners for the corporate houses as it does not take direct donations and grants.","['hiv', 'positive', 'children', 'orphans', 'foundation', 'trip', 'kids', 'smriti', 'away', 'abandoned', 'centre', 'care']","JAIPUR: It’s home away from home for the 20 children orphaned by HIV/AIDS .

The high incidence rates of HIV highlight the crucial need for intensified efforts to develop an efficacious vaccine.""The MRKAd5 HIV-1 vaccine was designed to ensure T-cells-mediated immune responses that would provide complete or partial protection from HIV-1 infection or a decrease in viral load after being administered.The study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in five sites in South Africa. The vaccine and placebo were given by intramuscular injections on a 0, 1, 6-month schedule to about 800 subjects.It concluded that ""34 participants in the vaccine group were diagnosed with HIV-1 and 28 in the placebo group. There was no evidence of vaccine efficacy. Vaccine efficacy did not differ by sex, age, herpes status or circumcision.""Now, all eyes are on two discoveries that were made in 2009. First, there were two powerful new antibodies that neutralized all major forms of the virus from the body of an African man. An antibody is an infection-fighting protein produced by our immune system when it detects harmful substances like viruses and bacteria.These two antibodies were also found to target a stable portion of the virus that does not frequently mutate — a defense mechanism that has till now helped the virus escape earlier developed experimental vaccines. Experts are looking at exactly where the antibodies bind to the virus. This will tell them which part of the virus to target with vaccines.Researchers believe they can create an effective vaccine if they are able to get the human body to produce such neutralizing antibodies before exposure to HIV.Scientists are looking at a trial of a Thai HIV vaccine, which in 2009 successfully had cut the risk of HIV infection in humans by 31%. In the largest human trial of an AIDS vaccine — involving more than 16,000 volunteers in Thailand — scientists found that HIV infections were prevented in over a third of the 8,000 volunteers, who received the vaccine.Since HIV was first identified in 1981, 40 millions have been infected with the virus. Annually, an estimated four million new infections occur, of which 90% are in developing countries. AIDS has claimed more than 25 million lives over the past 25 years.A vaccine will be a boon for India, where 1.2 lakh new people got infected with the virus in 2009. India, saddled with with 2.4 million HIV patients, ranks third after South Africa and Nigeria as far as HIV burden is concerned.","['fails', 'hiv', '2009', 'vaccine', 'hiv1', 'virus', 'efficacy', 'trial', 'mrkad5', 'million', 'antibodies', 'infection']","NEW DELHI: The hunt for an effective vaccine against the lethal HIV remains elusive.In a phase-II double-blind, randomized test-of-concept study, another promising vaccine candidate — MRKAd5 HIV-1 — has failed to protect the subjects.Announced in the Lancet on Thursday, the paper says ""the MRKAd5 HIV-1 vaccine did not prevent HIV-1 infection or lower viral-load.

Police claim there at least 400 more ‘sex parlours’ operating in the city and their licenses can be cancelled once these are tracked down.Besides duping people, these parlours can trigger the spread of HIV , said a police officer officer. Delhi AIDS Control Society officials said approximately 22 per cent massage parlours in the city are potential hotbeds for HIV transmission. “We were getting frequent complaints from NGOs about such parlours and decided to investigate. We will now request National AIDS Control Organisation, Delhi police and the government to take swift action and sift fake parlours from genuine ones,’’ said a senior official.“Most victims do not lodge complaints as they fear social ostracization. Parlour owners too change their phone numbers frequently and they keep shifting shop from one rented premise to another. We will now take a more holistic approach to the problem,’’ said a police officer.The crime branch is now scanning bank details of the accused, Rajesh Singh, in the fake friendship club racket. Police are also trying to establish if similar fake clubs are being run in other parts of the country.Singh is on the run and police suspect he could be operating more such clubs and masseur centres from other areas of west Delhi like Vikaspuri.“If we find the gang was operating across the city and the country, we could charge them under MCOCA,” said a police officer.Police said this particular gang had been operating the racket for the past one year and was making over Rs 1.5 lakh every day by duping callers. The crime branch had on Saturday busted this gang in Janakpuri and arrested 25 people, including 20 women.Police said Singh was paying about Rs 75,000 rent every month for three offices in Janakpuri and had cheated people in several states, including, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.In the case of friendship clubs, the caller would be asked to get himself registered by depositing Rs 1,000 in a bank account.Once the caller registers himself, he would be offered three categories of women contacts for being friends — models for Rs 7,000, college girls for Rs 5,000 and housewives for Rs 3,000. Once the amount was transferred by the caller, Singh would withdraw it using ATM cards and the women would stop taking the calls.For masseur training centres, they only entertained male callers.“They would be told that they would not only teach them how to become a masseur, but also provide a list of clients. The callers would be asked to pay Rs 1,000 as registration fee, Rs 3,750 for the massage kit and Rs 7,000 for the lady trainer,” said Chand.","['gang', 'hiv', 'racket', 'fake', 'delhi', 'masseur', 'lens', 'sex', '400', 'clubs', 'parlours', 'sitting', 'singh', 'bomb', 'operating', 'rs']","NEW DELHI: After a fake friendship club and masseur-training racket was busted on Saturday, the police are preparing to crack down on more dubious clubs.

The extract of the leaf is added to a solution of silver nitrate and within minutes the entire solution turns into silver nanoparticles. Since, the method used for synthesis of these nanoparticles does not use any added chemicals, it is a cost effective and environmental friendly method.”Congress grass was introduced in India in 1956. It causes contact dermatitis in livestock and is reported to be poisonous to sheep. Humans too are affected by this weed with respiratory malfunction and dermatitis.He said the congress grass would make the farmers reap huge profits as the cost of synthesising one litre of silver nanoparticle is around just Rs 30 whereas the end product can fetch upto Rs 3.5 lakh in the international market.About the methodology, Vyom explained that leaves of congress grass were thoroughly washed thrice in distilled water for 15 min, dried, cut into fine pieces and were boiled with 100 ml of sterile distilled water up to 5 min and were filtered.A team of scientist from various universities of US, including the department of chemical engineering, University of Texas, have reported that silver nanoparticles interact with HIV-1 virus which inhibit the virus from binding to its host cells.Parthenium is responsible for the largest number of skin inflammation cases caused by contact with the plants surface, said Vyom. “I experimented with carrot grass as the pollen grains cause diseases like eczema, asthma and dermatitis.” he added.","['silver', 'hiv', 'grass', 'solution', 'virus', 'congress', 'weed', 'added', 'help', 'fight', 'water', 'nanoparticles', 'vyom']","The extract of the leaf is added to a solution of silver nitrate and within minutes the entire solution turns into silver nanoparticles.

These prisoners are getting free treatment from jail authorities under the de-addition programme called OST (Opioid Substitution Treatment).Jail sources said that prisoners did not know about their HIV status earlier and when they came to know about such programme in Tihar, they joined the centre. Officials say six to eight percent population of Tihar is HIV positive, but it is a fluctuating figure. “Presently, there are 11,800 prisoners in Tihar and this number keeps on fluctuating. So, HIV positive prisoners’ status is also variable because people come and go and they get treatment while being lodged here.

Before June 2008 Tihar jail had no mechanism to identify the HIV positive inmates and whenever any government agency of National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) asked the authorities, a rough figure was provided.

However, there are still important gaps.Young men are more likely to be informed about HIV prevention than young women. Recent demographic health surveys found that an estimated 74 per cent of young men know that condoms are effective in preventing HIV infection, compared to just 49 per cent of young women.In recent years, there has been significant progress in preventing new HIV infections among children as increasing numbers of pregnant women living with HIV have gained access to antiretroviral prophylaxis during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding. The number of children newly infected with HIV in 2009 was 26 per cent lower than in 2001.About 115 low and middle-income countries are providing optimal treatment regimens for pregnant women living with HIV as recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO).The report, however, said despite expanded access to antiretroviral therapy, a major treatment gap remains.At the end of 2010, nine million people who were eligible for treatment did not have access. Treatment access for children is lower than for adults.While the rate of new HIV infections has declined globally, the total number of HIV infections remains high, at about 7000 per day. The global reduction in the rate of new HIV infections hides regional variations.According to the report, above-average declines in new HIV infections were recorded in sub-Saharan Africa and in South-East Asia, while Latin America and the Caribbean experienced more modest reductions of less than 25 per cent.There has been an increase in rate of new HIV infections in Eastern Europe and in the Middle East and North Africa.According to the report, gender inequalities remain a major barrier to effective HIV responses.

Some 30 HIV affected students , including 13 girls, studying between class 3 and 8 in Chitamur Panchayat Union Middle School have been forced to stay away from the school since September 2010.The students had been going to the school in Perunkaranai since 2008, but their HIV status was largely unknown except to the school principal and the village panchayat president. “Some parents came to know about the children’s status through some teachers who were coming from the city last year, and raised the issue at the PTA meetings. They felt uneasy in sending their wards where some children are infected with HIV,” said K Panchanathan, head master, Chitamur Panchayat Union Middle School.The students are under the care of an NGO Arias Home of Hope. Before admitting them to the school in 2008, Arias Home had told the principal of the school about the children being HIV positive. The panchayat president also knew. The principal and the president had thought it better to not discuss the children’s health situation with others. But word got around.Rumours started spreading about HIV in the village. Some came to believe that the infection could spread through water, sharing food and urinals. “Many villagers did not want these children sharing space with other normal students. We were unable to convince them,” P S Elappan, president, Perunkkaranai village, one of the 42 villages in Chitamur Panchayat Union, in Kancheepuram, told The Times Of India.The children are undergoing free Anti Retro Viral Therapy (ART) at the Government Hospital of Thoracic Medicine (GHTM) in Tambaram Sanatorium. The NGO activists are taking classes for these students on their own under the Sarva Sisyan Abhiyan’s (SSA) Education For All scheme, which aims to provide education mainly for school dropouts.The NGO cites distance between the school and the home as a reason to withdraw the students from the panchayan union school. “Distance between the school and our home is around two kms and our children had to miss ART on many occasions as they found it difficult to come home during lunch and get ART and return to school again. I can’t say anything more as the issue is in the court,” Pannerselvam, program manager, Arias Home of Hope, told TOI.On May 30 this year, the Madras high court ordered notice to the school on a public interest litigation relating to this issue. The court also ordered notice to health and educational departments on the PIL filed by K Radhakrishnan of Chengalpet. The petitioner Radhakrishnan, who himself is an HIV-affected person, said that the children had the right to have free and compulsory education and refusal of education to them was a violation of fundamental right.","['hiv', 'village', 'school', 'children', 'forces', 'union', 'education', 'panchayat', 'stigma', 'president', 'students', 'told']","PERUNKARANAI (CHEYYUR): Children affected by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) have been stigmatised in Perunkaranai, near Melmaruvathur — a little over 130 km south of Chennai.

171,5-7-2011,['Sumitra Debroy'],https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg,"MUMBAI: The clever HIV virus could be present in drastically different variants in the bodily fluids — blood and semen — of the same individual. This was recently established by a study of 12 HIV infected men whose blood and semen samples were analyzed by Parel's National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health (NIRRH).The finding is significant, said scientists of NIRRH, as it negates the notion that an infected person can go slow on treatment or think of starting a family once the viral load in the bloodstream becomes undetectable.The study clearly established that the type and behaviour of the HIV virus present in the bloodstream of an infected individual could be drastically different from the type and behaviour of the virus present in the same individual's semen. In certain cases, it could look as if the individual is infected with two different types of virus altogether. The study, carried out by NIRRH in collaboration with the JJ Hospital 's medicine department, was recently published in the Journal of Medical Virology.Principal investigator Dr AH Bandivadekar told TOI that the study proves that the virus could disappear from the blood stream due to anti-retroviral therapy but still be very much present in thesemen. “This difference in the virus nature influences the transmission of HIV, the progression of the ailment, the virus' response to the host defence and also treatment,” he added.Further, Bandivadekar added that the study pointed out that sperm-associated virus too is a huge risk factor for HIV transmission and possibly for parent child transmission. “Therefore, assisted reproductive technology where sperm washing is used may not be termed as a completely safe procedure for maternal or fetal transmission of HIV,” he said.The study further adds to the intriguing nature of the virus as it adds to the unpredictability, given its nature of constant mutation. In several of the individuals studied, the viral count in the blood differed vastly from the count in semen.

Also, at least in two individuals, the virus load in the blood had gone belowdetectable levels, but there were significant quantities of the virus present in the semen. Simply put, the virus in the blood and semen infected the same individual in different ways.Head of JJ Hospital's ART centre and one of the investigators, Dr Alaka Deshpande, said the study also means that those on anti-retroviral medication should not think that it could keep the virus in both the compartments, blood and semen, under control.“It is now clear that there could be genetic differences in virus even if they are present in the same individual's body,” she added. “It only means that whenever a vaccine or drug is created, the variant nature of the virus has to be kept in mind so that it can attack all compartments,” she added.","['hiv', 'study', 'blood', 'virus', 'infected', 'transmission', 'nature', 'semen', 'exist', 'present', 'individual']","MUMBAI: The clever HIV virus could be present in drastically different variants in the bodily fluids — blood and semen — of the same individual.
In certain cases, it could look as if the individual is infected with two different types of virus altogether.
“This difference in the virus nature influences the transmission of HIV, the progression of the ailment, the virus' response to the host defence and also treatment,” he added.Further, Bandivadekar added that the study pointed out that sperm-associated virus too is a huge risk factor for HIV transmission and possibly for parent child transmission.

However, there are major challenges in reaching out to all pregnant women for ensuring institutional deliveries for all the 27 million pregnancies that happen annually,"" he said.He added, ""To meet this challenge, on June 1, 2011, a new initiative called Janani-Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK) was launched to promote institutional deliveries. Over and above the cash incentives paid for institutional deliveries at government health facilities, this scheme includes free hospitalization, free medicines, free consumables, free diagnostics, free diet (up-to three days in the case of normal delivery and seven days in the case of Caesarean section), free provision of blood and free transport to & fro from home to all pregnant women and their new born.""The minister exuded confidence that the scheme would encourage women to volunteer for HIV testing.","['nregs', 'hiv', 'free', 'patients', 'facility', 'institutional', 'extended', 'women', 'employment', 'wants', 'ensure', 'national', 'stigma', 'minister']","No child should be denied admission in schools and colleges because he or she is afflicted with HIV or because his or her parents are afflicted with this disease.

This will reduce the risk of HIV transmission through needle-syringe route as those taking the shots tend to share needle and syringe, Dr Nath told TOI.To start with, the AIDS control body will open three opiod substitution therapy (OST) centres, meant to give the oral drugs, in SCB Medical College, Cuttack besides Puri and Bargarh district headquarters hospitals. A doctor, a nurse and an outreach worker will be stationed in each of these centres.The OST centres will also counsel the users to reduce intake of drugs so they can quit gradually.

SALEM: About 750 HIV patients requiring advanced treatment in the state are forced to go without life-saving second-line anti-retroviral therapy (ART) drugs which are in short supply.Hospitals, which are supposed to hand them out free, say they don’t have adequate stocks of these medicines. Officials of the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO), the country’s nodal agency for prevention and control of HIV/AIDS, said the sudden increase in the number of patients receiving second-line of treatment has caused the countrywide shortage of these drugs. Healthcare experts and NGOs fear this would increase the number of patients dropping out of the drug regimen, causing more cases of drug resistance ART is a combination of highly advanced drugs meant to fight HIV infection and increase life expectancy of HIV-AIDS patients. If the first-line of treatment is not adequate to bring down the viral load, patients are given the second-line of drugs. Both these regimens are provided free of cost by NACO.In Tamil Nadu, only two ART centres provide second line of drugs. They are located in Tambaram in Chennai and in Salem city. At least 150 patients from Salem, Krishnagiri, Erode, Namakkal, Karur, Ooty and Coimbatore visit the Salem centre to collect a month’s dosage.For the past one month, patients have been asked to take higher dosage of pediatric drugs or purchase them from the retail market. Second-line ART regimen consists of tenofovir, lamivudin, atazanavir and ritonovir. But ART centre managers say that the NACO has not supplied them with ritonovir. Krishnagiri-based G Karunanidhi, member of Tamilnadu Networking People with HIV/AIDS, is among those prescribed the second line ART medicine. He visits the ART centre every month to collect his monthly quota of drugs.On July 18, the centre gave him medicines for only four days though his usual dosage is for a month. “They asked me to come back to Salem after four days to collect the remaining drugs. I went back on July 25 and I was told they had not received the stock,” he said. P Nagaraj of Salem Network of PLWHA wasn’t as lucky. He was asked to take the pediatric ART drugs. “They told me that I could take double the child’s dose.I avoided it as I feared side effects,” he said. Experts say the drugs may not produce the desired effect unless they are taken at the right time and dosage. Dr Sentha Krishnan, who is in charge of Salem ART centre, said there were no stocks of ritonovir tablets. “We have not received supply of the drugs from NACO since mid-July. We ask patients to take a combination of lopinavir-ritonovir tablets. It has no side effects.NACO has told us the stocks will be replenished in a few days,” she said. NACO's regional co-ordinator SThennarasu said the situation was the same all over the country. NACO's national programme officer (ART) BB Rewari confirmed that the number of persons taking second line ART has increased. “We have added five more centres to give the second line of ART drugs. We are doing our best to give everyone the medicines. Instead of buying from international companies, we are now planning to go in for local pharmaceutical companies,” he said.","['hiv', 'treatment', 'dosage', 'patients', 'drugs', 'second', 'denied', 'secondline', 'art', 'centre', 'salem', 'low', 'stock', 'line']","If the first-line of treatment is not adequate to bring down the viral load, patients are given the second-line of drugs.

But the city is rolling out a new plan for prevention – known as New Directions – which primarily funds organizations working with Caucasian, African American and Latino gay men, according to API community advocates.""Trikone is saddened by the San Francisco Public Health Department's decision to slash funding for HIV/AIDS programs affecting the API community,"" Harsha Mallajosyula, advocacy director for Trikone – an organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people – said.""Surveys have consistently shown that the API community is one of the most vulnerable communities to new HIV infections and these budget cuts will only curtail the testing and awareness efforts taking place in earnest,"" he added.""Allocating resources should correlate with consistent data that places API community in high risk category and not on how visible our community is.

The Wellness Center operates on an annual budget of $3.5 million, from federal funding and private grants and donations.The organization also does not have funding to provide direct HIV prevention to Asian American women in San Francisco. ""In the New Directions program, women are completely excluded,"" stated Sheth, noting that API women tend to get tested at very late stages, when they already have AIDS.""As a community, we are very family-oriented, and the stigma of having AIDS is so deep, we wouldn't want to dishonor our family by saying we have it,"" said Sheth, explaining why more APIs do not get tested for the virus.The Indian American community needs ""culturally competent"" organizations to provide HIV prevention services.But Grant Colfax, director of the HIV Prevention and Research Section in the San Francisco Department of Public Health AIDS Office, said the City would ensure that APIs received HIV prevention. ""They have not been cut out of the budget,"" he told India-West.The New Directions program has allocated funds proportionately within ethnicities, dedicating the biggest allotment to high-risk groups, said Colfax.According to data from the SFDPH, Caucasian, African American and Latino gay males are at the highest risk for acquiring new HIV infections, along with transgendered men and intravenous drug users. Asian Americans represented 11 percent of all new HIV infections in 2010, and 8.7 percent of people living with AIDS.Colfax said his budget was based on AIDS data for 2010, and added that 8.7 percent of funding – roughly $844,000 – would be allocated to organizations working on HIV prevention in the API community.Asked to name such organizations, Colfax pointed to Magnet, an organization for gay men which offers free sexual health services, including HIV testing. Magnet, however, has no APIs on its staff or advisory board and its Web site featured no Asian American men.There is no evidence of an increase in HIV infections among Asian American women in San Francisco, stated Colfax, adding that the SFDPH is working to make HIV testing a routine part of health care screenings.In an Aug. 1 meeting with several lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender organizations, Colfax acknowledged that APIs were a ""gap population"" and promised to look at additional options for HIV prevention for Asian Americans.Source: India-WestBy SUNITA SOHRABJI- India-West Staff Reporter","['american', 'hiv', 'community', 'budget', 'san', 'women', 'api', 'slashes', 'asian', 'organizations', 'francisco', 'americans', 'prevention']","""Trikone is saddened by the San Francisco Public Health Department's decision to slash funding for HIV/AIDS programs affecting the API community,"" Harsha Mallajosyula, advocacy director for Trikone – an organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people – said.

These HIV neutralizing antibodies are produced naturally by a minority infected with HIV, but who show no symptoms.The new antibodies that target the CD4 binding site on HIV — the site where the virus engages the T cells to initiate its infection — was isolated from blood serum samples across the world.Dr Rajat Goyal, IAVI's India head said, ""This cocktail of bNAbs will help us design the most effective immunogens, the active ingredients of vaccines, which will then help us find the elusive HIV vaccine. Only a minority, who are HIV-positive, begin to produce bNAbs after several years of infection. Animal studies suggest that such antibodies could block HIV infection if they were elicited by a preventive vaccine.""The 17 new bNAbs were isolated from four HIV-positive individuals that are mostly of African descent. Earlier in 2009, this same research team had found two potent bNAbs, PG9 and PG16.Dennis Burton, director of the IAVI Neutralizing Antibody Center , said, ""Most antiviral vaccines depend on stimulating the antibody response to work effectively. Because of HIV's remarkable variability, an effective HIV vaccine will probably have to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies. This is why we expect that these new antibodies will prove to be valuable assets in the field of AIDS vaccine research.""Experts say a vaccine against HIV is a must with 7,000 new HIV infections occurring daily and 9 million HIV-infected individuals unable to access life-saving antiretroviral medication.The new bNAbs are encouraging. Many of them bind to unknown molecular structures on the surface of HIV. This means that they could significantly broaden the target options researchers have in designing vaccines to elicit similar antibodies.Since HIV was first identified in 1981, 40 millions have been infected with the virus. Annually, an estimated four million new infections occur, of which 90% are in developing countries. Over the last 25 years, AIDS has claimed more than 25 million lives.It is widely believed that to prevent HIV infection, an AIDS vaccine would need to teach the body to produce these powerful antibodies before exposure to the virus.","['hiv', 'aids', 'vaccine', 'virus', 'bnabs', 'scientists', 'closer', 'million', 'isolate', 'antibodies', 'neutralizing', 'infection', 'vaccines']","Animal studies suggest that such antibodies could block HIV infection if they were elicited by a preventive vaccine.

The love and care continues to come their way, but the support has been withdrawn as these volunteers can no longer afford to provide it.

Since the last five months, the National AIDS Control Organisation has not been providing funds to many social outfits that provide counseling along with medical and other facilities to HIV positive people. This has forced a few of them to shut their operations completely. City-based NGO Nagpur Multipurpose Social Service Society, along with the two community care centers (CCCs), that catered to People Living with HIV (PLHs) and their children, have closed their operations.

""We have around 1380 children registered with us, some of them are themselves affected by HIV and some have parents suffering from AIDS. We tried to provide them emotional, educational and every kind of support. During the last five years of association with them, only 13 children died. The life span of the suffering kids has increased under our guidance as they got the required medication and nutrition,"" informed Sr. Daya Matthews, SMMI, the project director of project Chah.

NACO had conducted inspection of all the organizations that were receiving funds from them in February this year wherein all centres had got a favourable report. In fact, the centre at Mure Memorial Hospital had been upgraded from 'C' to 'A' category. Despite this, the funds were discontinued from the next financial year beginning in April.

After a couple of months, the representatives from CCCs from across the states of Maharashtra and Karnataka were running from pillar to post, trying to gather why this had happened. ""We have been trying to contact the authorities from NACO, who have remained non-communicative. We even visited their Delhi office but in vain,"" revealed Datta Patil, executive director of Youth for Unity & Voluntary Action (YUVA) that runs one such centre in Beed.

However, Dr Bhalchandra Kinikar of Niramaya Arogya Dham, Solapur, said that they have received some reassurance from Karnataka Health Promotion Trust (KHPT), the organization that distributes the funds to the NGOs in the two states, that the files have moved up and the money may come in soon.

Under this project, many of the children who had left their education midway were reinducted, while many others were provided with employment opportunities. They were also informed about the various government schemes they could benefit from. The organization, however, has had to discontinue all its activities due to lack of funds. ""We could not keep our staff, many of whom were PLHs, as there were no means of sustaining them,"" said Sr Daya.

The condition of the CCCs is no different. Amrita Joshi, who runs the centre at Rameshwari recounts the measures she had to resort to for cost cutting. ""We had to do away with some of our staff. We now have no janitor, cook or nurse. The guidelines given by NACO regarding the number of people we can employ is already insufficient. If more people are required the NGO itself has to arrange for their salaries,"" she said.

The Mure Memorial Hospital CCC which used to get a footfall of over a hundred patients every month, now, only sees a few people coming in. ""We too had to relieve one of our nurses. The actual need is of three nurses but we have two, with one being provided by the hospital whenever there is a need.

KOLKATA: She was born a thalassaemia major, contracted HIV through blood transfusion that kept her alive and was thrown out of Bankura Sammilani Medical College which refused to treat her in 2010. Ramtanu Ghoshal didn't know whom to turn to with his 10-year-old daughter Manasi (name changed) till he travelled to Kolkata and sought help from doctors at the Aids unit of Calcutta Medical College Hospital last November. By then, the youngster's spleen had got enlarged and her blood cells were fast disintegrating. Treatment at the hospital and a surgery at a city cancer institute has given little Manasi a fresh lease of life. But it could be a temporary reprieve, according to doctors.

""She was diagnosed as a thalassaemia patient when she was just 11 months old. Ever since, Manasi has been on transfusion. But it was two years ago that we were left devastated by a blood test that revealed she was HIV-positive. She contracted the virus during one of the numerous transfusions that she had gone through at the Bankura Medical College. Even though they were responsible, the hospital refused to carry on treatment and forced us to seek help in Kolkata,"" said Ramtanu, a farmer from Bankura.

After a six-month stint at Calcutta Medical College last year, Manasi was moved to the Netaji Subhas Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) in March, 2011. She was then staring at death. Manasi had hypersplenism (enlarged spleen) - a result of repeated blood transfusions that had led to iron deposits in her system. Her blood cells and platelets were breaking up, leading to a sharp fall in RBC and WBC counts. Manasi's haemoglobin count, too, had plummeted and she needed a transfusion every week.

Only a spleenectomy or a spleen replacement surgery could revive her. ""It's always risky to operate an HIV patient. Manasi had thalassaemia as well and was extremely frail when she same to us. But what made us worry was the fall in her blood cell count that had virtually reduced her immunity to zero. Being HIV-positive, she was in danger of succumbing to the virus unless the blood cell counts were normalised immediately,"" said Ashish Mulhopadhyay, director, NCRI.

On September 3, a team of surgeons comprising Supriyo Ghatak, Sumit Gulati, Niladri Bhattacharya, Ranjan Bhandari and Jhumka Datta, conducted a spleenectomy on Manasi. The surgery has ressurected the girl. Her red blood cell, white blood cell and platelet counts have already shown a marked improvement. She will now need a blood transfusion only once every three months. ""More importantly, her immunity has improved, which will act as a shield against HIV. But this is a temporary reprieve and Manasi must remain under treatment for the rest of her life,"" said Supriyo Ghatak, a visiting surgeon at NCRI.","['hiv', 'manasi', 'transfusion', 'medical', 'blood', 'second', 'thalassaemia', 'chance', 'cell', 'treatment', 'girl', 'college', 'surgery', 'gives']","She contracted the virus during one of the numerous transfusions that she had gone through at the Bankura Medical College.

Little hearts, but sunk by an overwhelming thought that death may strike early. They live in the shadows and prefer anonymity for fear of discrimination. And those who go to school are often ostracized. Nor do they get specialized treatment despite massive funds being pumped for HIV care. What’s shocking is that their numbers are in thousands in Delhi. The city has at least 11,333 children infected with HIV. Most of them, nearly 2000, are concentrated in south Delhi and around 1,700 in the New Delhi area. Others are scattered across the city.The plight of these children has been highlighted in a study commissioned by the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR). The report states that the nine anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centres are not wellequipped and HIV-infected kids are yet to receive benefits of any government scheme. DCPCR has now sent its recommendations to the Delhi government for rehabilitation of these children. A potent anti-retroviral regimen helps suppress the HIV virus and preserves normal immune response in children.The study was carried out by ARADHYA (Action for Resource Development in Health-Education by Youth Association) over a period of four months — starting March this year. The objective was to map children infected by HIV. Volunteers collected data from the Delhi State AIDS Control Society, ART centres, integrated counseling centres, blood banks, private doctors, counsellors and related agencies to find out the number of HIV patients in the city. Since many cases go unreported, the actual number may be much higher. The report also mentions there are 68,369 HIV-infected persons in the age-group of 14-24 .“We received complaints about discrimination of HIVinfected children in schools. It was then that we decided to collect data on these children. There are at least 77,000 kids below 14 years of age in the country who are HIV-infected . Over 11,000 are in Delhi alone,” said M M Vidyarthi, member, DCPCR.He also said most kids contract HIV from their mothers. Many of those registered for treatment hail from migrant families. Since many of them don’t have identity or residential proofs, they lose out on welfare schemes. HIV-infected kids orphaned by AIDS do not even have a means of livelihood.“Though most parents are sensitive towards their children , they don’t put them through institutional medical care for fear of discrimination ,” he said.

The case will be heard by Chief Justice J Chelameswar and Justice PR Ramachandra Menon on Wednesday.

Foundation for Integrated Research in Mental Health, a voluntary health organization based at Thiruvananthapuram, has taken up the case of an HIV positive patient who was denied treatment by a private hospital at Thiruvananthapuram and is moving a petition before the high court challenging the stances taken by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and Kerala State Aids Control Society (KSACS) towards the treatment denial.

Ashok Nair, who is HIV positive, was denied treatment when he was taken to Cosmopolitan hospital at Thiruvananthapuram after he suffered multiple fractures in a traffic accident. He was advised of the need for urgent surgery as he had suffered multiple fractures and was taken to the trauma care wing of the hospital. Ashok told the hospital staff that he was HIV positive. Upon learning that he was HIV positive, the hospital authorities denied to provide treatment to him and referred him to the Medical College Hospital of Thiruvananthapuram.

Ashok approached the human rights commission questioning the hospital's denial of treatment. KSACS enquired into the incident and submitted a report that accepted the hospital's stance that the patient was sent back as he was in need of surgery for which the hospital didn't have facilities. When the petition by Ashok was considered by NHRC, it accepted KSACS' report and dismissed allegations of treatment denial.The petitioner alleges that the explanation by the hospital is not credible as their website boasts of a specialty clinic for orthopaedic and trauma care.","['hospital', 'hiv', 'positive', 'court', 'taken', 'human', 'denied', 'petition', 'moves', 'thiruvananthapuram', 'patient', 'ksacs', 'treatment']","KOCHI: Patients infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) are being denied treatment by hospitals in the State, points out a petition before the Kerala High Court.

While growing need for spreading awareness among high risk groups like commercial sex workers and migrant populations was highlighted during the one-day visit of director general (DG) of NACO, Aradhana Jauhari, to various ART centres in the city on Tuesday, the changing dynamics of HV/AIDS in east UP and Bihar regions of the country also attracted attention on the occasion.

""Awareness holds the key for curbing the menace of HIV in eastern UP region and parts of Bihar that have now become the high priority areas for National AIDS Control Organisation NACO,"" said Jauhari while talking to TOI after visiting the ART centre at Banaras Hindu University (BHU) on Tuesday.

Saying that the invisible killer has continued to spread its tentacles in the Hindi speaking states like UP, Bihar, MP and Rajasthan, she stressed that the selected pockets of east UP and Bihar with high migrant population remain high risk zones in the country.

Apart from Varanasi, Jaunpur and Ghazipur, other pockets like Azamgarh-Bhiwandi-Mau and Patna-Muzaffarpur in Bihar have a good number of migrating people who are infecting their family members and local population with the HIV virus.

There is an urgent need to spread awareness among the high risk groups of migrant population and devise a strategy to effectively address the issue, she said.

It may be mentioned here that the DG of NACO visited ART centres of BHU, SPG Divisional Hospital and DDU Hospital besides holding a meeting of UP NACO officials and other senior district health officials in the day.

Stressing the fact that prevention is the only cure in this case, the DG said that eastern UP and Bihar states could learn from the experiences of Tamil Nadu and other southern states that have shown reversal in the trend with receding cases in the last few years.

Similarly, advocating for establishment of more ART centres in east UP and Bihar, she also maintained that counselling, support and care services offered through ART centres including integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC) and voluntary counselling and testing centres (VCTC) need to play pro-active role in spreading awareness.

The overall prevalence rate of HIV infection has reduced to 50% in the last one decade, but still the figure is high particularly in the Hindi speaking states. A prevalence rate of 0.3% is far from satisfactory and much work is yet to be done to bring it further down, she added.","['hivaids', 'bihar', 'hiv', 'reduce', 'states', 'naco', 'centres', 'population', 'high', 'risk', 'art', 'need', 'cases', 'awareness']","There is an urgent need to spread awareness among the high risk groups of migrant population and devise a strategy to effectively address the issue, she said.

Some of our officials were sent to Ichalkaranji. They approached the person and expressed willingness to purchase the kit.

An ICTC is a place where a person is counselled and tested for HIV, on his own free will or as advised by a medical provider. There are now more than 4,000 counselling and testing centres in India, mainly at government hospitals. In Maharashtra, there are 578 ICTCs where testing and counselling is provided free.

A corrupt counseller was arrested last week and both he and a lab technician, also involved in the alleged racket, have been dismissed from their job.

The incident came to light when Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS) officials in Mumbai were informed that outreach workers of an NGO in Kolhapur were trying to sell HIV testing kits. The rapid testing kits, which can reveal an individual's HIV status in less than 30 minutes, is provided to the MSACS by the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) for free. The MSACS later distributes the kits to its 578 integrated centre for counselling and testing (ICTC) centres across the state.

On getting the information, the MSACS officials decided to nab the culprits. Once the investigation started, the officials found that one of their own counsellors, Raghunath Kamble, and lab technician Hemlata Patil were the masterminds and the NGO workers were mere mediators.

Additional project director Dr Dilip Deshmukh, who helped nab the culprits with the help of MSACS officials from Kolhapur, told TOI that the incident was shocking and something that the agency had never witnessed. ""The culprit has been handed over to the police and a case has been registered. We are now checking if such a racket exists in other parts of the state,"" he said.

District superviser of Kolhapur Niranjan Deshpande was the first one to learn about the racket. Subsequently, on finding that Naagsen Kamble, an outreach worker from Lotus Medical Foundation, was trying to sell the testing kits to private labs, Deshmukh sent some officials as decoy customers.

These officials contacted Naagsen, who on September 19 called them to say the deal would be sealed in a hotel at Jaysinghpur, a small town in Kolhapur. ""As our officials, posing as customers, reached the hotel, they found that it was one of our counsellors, Raghunath, who was trying to sell the kits,"" said Deshmukh, adding that he offered Rs 5,000 for two kits, which can conduct up to 100 tests. Deshmukh then contacted the police who arrested Raghunath.

During his interrogation, the counsellor told the police that lab technician Hemlata also had some testing kits at her home. ""Hemlata's house was searched and around 30 kits were recovered from her refrigerator,"" added Deshmukh. He said both Raghunath and Hemlata had been dismissed from MSACS. ""We have asked other agencies to be extra cautious,"" he added.

The HIV/AIDS positive rate in the state, however, is at an all time low, even as the number of people testing for HIV/AIDS is the highest ever.

Between 1986 and 2011, over three lakh persons have undergone the test to check for their HIV status in Goa. Of these, 13,913 individuals have tested HIV positive and 1,453 have resulted in AIDS cases to date. The number of male AIDS patients in Goa, between 1986 and 2011, has been more than double at 1,009 of the 444 females detected with the ailment.

The highest number of HIV positive cases were reported in Goa in 2007. The number of cases came down to 1,019 in the following year and to 959 in 2009. Last year, the HIV positive cases came further down to 821 and to 459 this year till August. The positivity rate has also come down from 13.41% in the late '90s to 4.77% in 2007 and just 1.86% in 2011 so far.

The number of persons testing for HIV, however, has grown exponentially from just 2,279 in 1995 to as much as 18,380 by 2006. The number went up further to 26,737 in 2008 and touched an all time high in the following year to 33,473. In the present year, already 24,691 persons have tested for HIV up to August. This increase in numbers can be attributed to increased awareness of the ailment brought about through state and central government efforts.

Over the years, the Goa State Aids Control Society (GSACS) has set up Integrated Counseling and Testing Centers (ICTCs) in three private hospitals in addition to 14 ICTCs operational in government hospitals.

An ICTC is where a person goes for counseling and testing for HIV. The person comes entirely of his/her own will or as advised by a medical practitioner. The ICTCs provide HIV testing with pre-test and post-test counseling, drugs for opportunistic infections, free distribution of condoms and follow-up counseling for HIV positive cases through field visits. The centres also provide testing, pre-test and post-test counseling to pregnant mothers who come for ante-natal check ups.

On Saturday, two HIV positive women narrated their sordid tales in a media workshop organized by the Rajasthan Network for People Living With HIV/AIDS (RNP+) in Jaipur.

They said that the attitude of their inlaws changed when they came to know that they were detected HIV positive. One of them, Manju, said: ""The brother of my husband badly behaved with me when my husband died of AIDS. They expelled me from the house.""

Manju's inlaws live in Tonk district. She has two daughters - one is 11-years-old and the other is 8-years-old. Both of them were tested HIV negative.

Another woman, Sita from Dholpur, had the same story to tell. She said her husband thrashed him badly when he came to know that she is infected with HIV virus. She was also expelled from the house along with her 7-year-old HIV positive daughter.

The RNP+ (women's wing) president Mona said, ""These are not the only two HIV positive women who are expelled by their inlaws. There are so many such cases which have come to light in the past.""

She said that such women have to face criticism and they also get stigmatized. ""If the husband and wife both are HIV positive and wife gets tested positive for HIV before husband, then she has to face a lot of criticism and also her husband put a blot on her character. There are so many such cases,"" Mona said.

The 200-page notebook has details of her treatment from the day she tested HIV positive. Five years ago, when her husband Raman, a rabbit-hunter, died due to AIDS-related illness what he left was a ruined house and five children. Muniyammal somehow managed to get a loan from the bank and renovated the house.

Adding fuel to the fire, she was tested positive two years after her husband's death. The couple's sons left their mother once they got to know about her status. Now, with bouts of TB attack, Muniyammal has to take care of her two daughters, Pachammal (13) and Meenammal (11). Muniyammal's is not a lone case, there are many like her in the Achapatti Street in Kariapatti, a panchayat town near Aruppukottai in Virudhunagar district.

Kariapatti has a population of 1.65 lakh. The number of HIV cases is increasing in this village due to various reasons. In 2008, there were only 17 HIV cases recorded, but in 2009 it rose to 55 and in 2010, it went to 58. There are 22 discordant couples in Kariapatti area alone. At least 45 people have been tested positive so far this year. There are three main reasons for the increased rate of HIV incidents in Kariapatti, according to Mercy Annapurni of the Blossom Trust, an NGO based in Virudhunagar.

""There is a sizable population of masons who go to Mumbai, Tirupur and Coimbatore for temporary works and return with the virus. Since Kariapatti is the town for all the other villages, transgenders from other places come in groups and camp in the town for commercial sex. The drivers of trucks passing by this area during night halt near Ramu Seethai Polytechnic in Manthiriodai for sex. The place has become a high-risk area now,"" says Annapurni.

Vadivammal Kamala, another villager says she knew about her status only after her husband's death. Living alone in an old house without any proper income, none of her four children visit their mother. Frustrated, the 49-year-old even skips her medicine. And this, according to health-worker Muthulakshmy, is a serious problem.

""Social stigma prevents many from having medicines on time. If the patients are aged, then the level of frustration they are undergoing will be high. Many even skip their medicines due to this. We have to monitor each and every one,"" says Muthulakshmy, who has been working for the welfare of the villagers for 10 years.

Even though none of the children of Muniyammal and Kamala Meenakshi did not test HIV positive for HIV as both the mothers contracted the disease from their husbands, in the later stages of their life, Rajam was unlucky.

She was not aware of her status until she gave birth to her daughter. Staying in a rented house, she struggles to meet the day's end. ""I don't have a regular income. My daughter is studying. I don't know how to survive,"" she says.

Despite being a high-risk area, the village also suffers from several a lot of civic issues. Drinking water, according to the villagers, reaches them once in a week.

""We get drinking water only once in a week. Our drainage is choked. Even though the previous government promised us houses, it has not been materialized so far,"" says Munisamy, a villager. However, talking to TOI, a panchayat official said, ""We are conducing regular health-check up for the HIV positive people in all the villages in Kariapatti. Free medicines are given to them. We will definitely look into the civic issues,"" says the official, who didn't want to be named.

222,5-12-2011,['Kounteya Sinha'],https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg,"NEW DELHI: India will not allow home testing for HIV. The country’s National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) is against allowing finger pricks or mouth swabs to be used by individuals to know their HIV status.



A variety of tests are now available which can produce results in 1–20 minutes. The cost of these tests are also low. However, NACO says its policy is clear – testing will have to accompany pre-testing and post-result counselling. “Self-testing is against Indian national treatment guidelines. We don’t allow it,” a NACO official said.



A UNAIDS report on Monday said the world was opening up to home testing for HIV since fewer than half of those living with HIV knew their status. This is, therefore, a huge barrier to treatment scale up. In India, 40% of the 2.3 million people living with HIV don’t know that they are infected with the deadly virus.



A senior health ministry official said, “We don’t want people to self-test and then commit suicide or self harm because they are HIV positive. Also, the quality of such tests are under scrutiny. What if the person harms himself after finding himself HIV positive but he is actually HIV negative?”Around 8,000 centres across India counsel people who undertake a HIV test. In 2010, an estimated 6 million people got tested for HIV. “Counselling is vital. We tell those who get tested and are found HIV positive how to lead a healthy life, how we will connect them to care, support and treatment services, put them on nutritional support and prevent further spread of the virus. In case they are found negative, they are counselled on how to stay that way and about safe sex,” the official said.However, the UNAIDS report 2011 talks about self-testing. “Despite the advances in technology, testing is still approached with fear, accessing clinics is inconvenient and the experience of HIV testing is often stigmatizing,” the report said.“A recent national study in Kenya showed only 16% of HIV-infected adults knew that they were infected. A variety of tests, from finger pricks to mouth swabs, can now produce results in 1–20 minutes. The cost of these tests is now measured in cents,” the report added.One model, according to UNAIDS, has estimated that up to half of new HIV infections among children are caused by stigma, because women refuse to take tests or fail to collect their results. “One option to radically shift test access is self-testing at home. Information and support could be provided remotely. Most importantly, those who tested positive would need a clear access path to health care, starting with a confirmatory test. In September 2011, the United Kingdom’s House of Lords’ select committee on AIDS recommended repealing laws that prohibit home HIV testing,” the report said.","['hiv', 'positive', 'testing', 'allow', 'test', 'tested', 'support', 'report', 'treatment', 'unaids', 'india', 'tests']","NEW DELHI: India will not allow home testing for HIV.

Adhar has decided to support HIV positive patients who struggle everyday for tackling even small problems due to fear of people and sometimes due to ignorance. Advocacy group run by Adhar would help HIV patients in creating awareness among them.

Talking to TOI, Vidya Tayde, founder of Adhar, said that HIV patients face many problems. From financial problem to fear of social stigma and ignorance about various welfare projects meant for them and treatments, these people are found struggling. Hence, to redress their problems, Alliance, an NGO, has formed advocacy groups to help HIV patients for improving their life at every stage. Alliance has started this project in Amravati, Nagpur, Ahmednagar, Thane and Kolhapur. In Amravati, Alliance has selected Adhar for implementation of this programme, said Tayde. This project will prove to be a boon for HIV positive people. Adhar, under its PACT (promoting access care and treatment project), has already started advocacy. But under this project, the advocacy work will gain momentum and more and more people can be given information which is important for them. Tayde said that the project started from November 1. Presently, analysis and work planning is done as the staff required for the purpose is insufficient, she said.

When asked what are the major issues which HIV positive patients have to deal with, Tayde said HIV positive patients face problem during surgery.

At present, national policy allows only voluntary testing.“It is more than evident that the women are getting the infection from their husbands, ” said Ramesh D ev k a r, MSACS project director. Lending credibility to this is a study published in the Journal of American Medical Association in 1997 by a researcher from Pune’s National Aids Research Institute, which put the percentage of women getting HIV from their husbands at 92.“We have to work towards a societal norm where couples insist on testing before tying the knot. Of course, making testing legal is not an option,” Devkar said. This year, 2,027 pregnant women in the rest of Maharashtra and 385 in Mumbai tested positive for HIV. Over the years, the number in the state has gone down: from 4,783 in 2006, to 4,552, 4,162, 3,724 and 3,361 in subsequent years. This year, the number is 2,412 (till October). But the number is still around 3,000. “That means the birth of at least 2,000 HIV-positive children. That is how high the probability of a child getting the infection from the mother is,” said Devkar.“The debate is between discrimination and the possibility of saving two lives.” Many infected women support premarital HIV testing. Kurla resident Ananda (38; name changed) said: “I have faced the stigma of living with HIV for 11 years. My husband passed away a few years ago. I was ostracized by my in-laws to the extent that they did not allow me to meet my son for two years. I got his custody only after my mother-in-law died. Both I and my child would have been spared such a horrible life had pre-marital testing been mandatory.”","['hiv', 'grows', 'aids', 'premarital', 'pregnant', 'number', 'testing', 'women', 'getting', 'prenup', 'national', 'state', 'clamour']","Of course, making testing legal is not an option,” Devkar said.

""Many positive developments have taken place in the last one decade and they have bolstered our confidence to fight against social stigma and lack of awareness about HIV infection in the region. Though there is a long way to go for changing the mindset of society about the HIV infection, the progress made in the last one decade has been encouraging and promising,"" said Manoj Singh, president of Banaras Network for Positive People Living with HIV/AIDS Society , a social and voluntary organisation run by HIV positive people in the city.

Highlighting the change in attitude and approach of HIV positive people in the last one decade, he said that while HIV infected people were not ready to even talk about the infection a decade back, now, they have started to open up and look curious to know about the facilities and treatments available. The taboo attached with the infection is slowly diminishing and even the people from rural background are coming forward to share their problems and experiences, added the man, who waged a battle against the lack of awareness and social stigma along with a group of HIV positive people in the region in 2002.

The organisation provides care and support services to HIV positive people who come for screening and treatment at the ART centre, BHU. It has also come up with training and community care counselling to sensitise people in the region. How HIV positive people are opening up could be also gauged from the fact that around 700 HIV positive people have already joined the network to spread awareness in the region. Manoj Singh is living with ART treatment for the last 12 years. The network has also initiated efforts like education support to orphans (losing parents due to HIV infection) and HIV infected children (5-14 years of age).

There's precious little in them, barring a few unstable beds, some fitted with saline stands, and rickety chairs that cover less than half the dusty floors. The rest is frightfully bare even for a rural hospital.

Here, in a cubby-hole, unsanitized chamber, where breathing takes an effort, a team of two doctors, with help from a couple of nurses, helped two HIV-positive women deliver babies this week. There was no hitch and no one refused to attend to the women or humiliated them. On the contrary, the mothers have been assured that the gates of Khanakul Rural Hospital, 120 km from Kolkata - where the feat was pulled off on Monday-Tuesday - will remain open to them for treatment and counselling.

Prosenjit Pal, the lone gynaecologist at the hospital, had general physician Susanta Pal for company during the deliveries, one of which was a complicated C-section. They had an anaesthetist and nurses Amita Batabyal and Swati Pal helping them. Both women, aged about 25, are healthy and the newborns - a boy and a girl - are doing fine. Their HIV status, however, is still not clear.

The team is proud of its achievement but believes they have just done their duty. ""We were just keen to help these poor women deliver safely. Without our support they would have been helpless, probably even ostracized by the community and left to die without treatment. Ever since they sought our help nine months ago, we were determined to shield them from all adversities and make sure they delivered safely. It was not easy but we managed to do our job,"" said Prosenjit Pal.

The women, who probably contracted the deadly virus from their husbands, visited the ramshackle hospital for a pregnancy test earlier this year. To their horror, doctors found that both had HIV. They were immediately taken to the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) and briefed.

""There were a hundred odds. Touts at the hospital, neighbours and the stigma of an incurable disease with its sexual connotation. But we were determined not to let these affect the women. We took it on as a challenge and kept monitoring them regularly till they got admitted for their delivery,"" said Susanta Pal.

Regular checks, counselling and advice through their pregnancy helped the women gain confidence. The doctors and the hospital counsellor Abhijit Maity even counselled their families, convincing them that the disease, though incurable, was not as contagious as it is made out to be. And that they needed their support.

It worked. The families stood by the women and made sure no one got to know about their illness. Prosenjit Pal then got about preparing his team for the delivery. Some hospital staff initially refused to cooperate but block medical officer Sabyasachi Saha moved in and made it clear that no one would be allowed to shirk responsibility. ""I told each staff member that they would be thrown out if they refused to work for the patients. There was no murmur after that,"" said Saha.

As the delivery date approached, doctors tried to gather all the meagre resources that they had at their disposal. The OT was disinfected and the floors cleaned painstakingly. ""We knew it was not enough and that the babies were still at risk. But we left no stone unturned,"" said Susanta Pal.

Last week, it was detected that one of the women had a complication that would necessitate a C-section. So, we had to be on our toes and called for a last-minute meeting to make sure things were in order. We were tense and excited at the same time,"" said Prosenjit Pal.

The team camped at the hospital on Sunday night and readied for the first delivery on Monday - the normal one. It went off smoothly with the woman delivering a healthy boy. The next day was the real test. ""Our OT does not have the basic facilities for a Caesarean, which is why such surgeries are not done here. In this case, we couldn't refer her to another hospital, for she would certainly have been refused. Also, neither woman could afford the cost of a sustained treatment,"" said Saha.

The surgery was a success with the woman giving birth to a girl. The umbilical cord had got entangled around the baby's neck, but it was successfully negotiated by Pal. ""It was a huge relief for all of us. For nine months, we had been waiting for this day,"" he said. ""The biggest satisfaction is that we have broken the myth and set aside all the obstacles, practically doing the surgery out of nothing,"" said Susanta Pal.

Lab technician Saradindu Manna was moved to see the tears in the women's eyes after delivery. ""It reminded us that HIV-infected people have a right to live,"" he said.

For 72 hours, the entire team, including the doctors and counsellor Maity stayed put at the hospital, making sure nothing went wrong. No special precautions were taken by doctors other than gloves, an extra gown and glasses. The mothers and their babies were given Neviropine to try and make sure the newborns didn't contract the virus. ""It's still too early to know that. We are keeping our fingers crossed,"" said Prosenjit Pal.","['hospital', 'positive', 'hiv', 'script', 'delivery', 'doctors', 'susanta', 'women', 'rural', 'sure', 'pal', 'team', 'docs', 'prosenjit', 'refused']","Prosenjit Pal, the lone gynaecologist at the hospital, had general physician Susanta Pal for company during the deliveries, one of which was a complicated C-section.

However, by this time, nearly 50% of the children born to HIV positive mother die.

However, a new technique called dry blood sample testing helps in early detection of the disease and saving lives.

Under the new technique a child's blood sample is taken from the heel when the baby is about six-week-old. The blood sample is dropped over a filter paper, dried and sent to the National Centre for Disease Control (formerly known as National Institute for Prevention of Communicable Diseases). Microbiologists examine the sample using polymerase chain reaction to detect the presence of HIV virus.

In case the virus is found, the referral centre is asked to send the patient to the nearest Anti-Retroviral Therapy centre for a repeat test using whole blood samples.

Prof AK Tripathi, head of ART centre at Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj Medical University, which offers this testing, said, ""More than 90% of children born with HIV get virus from their parents. The test would help in saving lives or at least improving the quality of life led by them.""

Keeping the same in mind, early infant diagnosis services were scaled up in the state.

The dried blood testing facility is available at 32 integrated counselling and testing centres in various government hospitals and medical colleges.

Medical reports shows 33% of infected mothers would transmit the virus to their babies in the absence of preventive treatment. This happens in three different conditions. First is pregnancy in which the infection is transmitted through the mother's blood.

Experts say that the baby is more at the risk if the mother has been recently infected or is at a later stage of AIDS when the viral load is higher.

The second risk period is at the time of birth when the baby is exposed to the infected mother's vaginal secretions ad blood.

The infant is at the risk of disease during the period of breast-feeding as well.

The virus has been found in breast milk in low concentrations and studies have shown that children of HIV infected mother can get HIV infection through breast milk.","['hiv', 'disease', 'children', 'blood', 'mothers', 'testing', 'virus', 'infected', 'early', 'prevent', 'centre', 'sample', 'detection', 'infection']","However, a new technique called dry blood sample testing helps in early detection of the disease and saving lives.

This CD4 cells help us to fight against infections. Thus destruction of these cells by the virus leads to immune deficiency and susceptibility to different infections.

# How it spreads: HIV infection spreads through unsafe sexual contact, transfusion of infected blood or blood products, sharing needles to inject drugs and from mother to child during childbirth and breast-feeding. However, HIV does not spread through mosquito bites, tear, saliva, urine, by embracing, casual kissing, handshakes, working together, taking bath or swimming together with HIV infected person. In India, migrant population, truck drivers, sex workers and IV drug abusers are the worst affected. They in turn spread the disease to their wives, children and clients.

# How to get tested: Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) provides free testing and counselling. ICTC centres are present in every district hospital and medical colleges. Those who test positive are referred to the nearest Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre.

# Treatment: Once a person is infected with HIV virus, the virus can never be eliminated from the body. However, there are drugs available which can suppress the level of virus in the body. These drugs are available free of cost at all ART centres. Every HIV positive patient may not be put on treatment immediately. The treatment is started on the basis of CD4 count and stage of the disease. The treatment has to be continued lifelong. It is extremely important to adhere to the treatment to prevent failure of the drug regimen.

# Who To Approach: The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) control programme through 35 HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Societies, and 269 ART centres throughout the country. The ART centre at MLN Medical College provides HIV testing, treatment, counseling, nutritional advice and AVR drugs to the registered patients.

# Protection & Support To Children affected with AIDS: In the short term, National Aids Control Programme is reaching out to as many children living with HIV as possible to provide them with the treatment and the care and support services that they need.

That's the moral of the story of Heera and Rani, both HIV positive. They are happily married and blessed with two daughters, one of whom has been confirmed as HIV negative while the other is yet to attain the age to undergo the medical test.

Heeralal Rajak, now 36, hails from Garahara village in Begusarai district, 150km from Patna . He was detected HIV positive in 2000. The government would not offer any medical help to people with AIDS in Bihar then. Things became worse for Heera when his Patna-based doctor left Bihar for good in 2004.Heera would then travel to Varanasi to take free medicines from the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre at BHU . He also joined Bihar Network for People Living with HIV-AIDS Society (BNP+) and started helping people with HIV.

It was in 2007 when Heera had taken two HIV positive persons to a hospital at nearby Mokama that he spotted Rani, a native of Saran district. A widow, now 27, she was all alone after her husband with AIDS died in 2005.

Rani's late husband was a daily wage earner in Delhi.



""I inquired about her and came to know she was HIV positive and ostracized by her society. Anything and everything done by her, including food cooked by her, was a no-no for her family and neighbours,"" Heera told TOI over phone from his village on Thursday.



Heera fell for Rani. ""I would often make telephone calls to her and inquire about her health,"" he said and added they tied the knot in March 2008 with the consent of their families.



The couple's joy knew no bounds when their first daughter, Deepali, tested HIV negative.



""She was born in December 2008. We strictly followed the prescriptions of doctors during the pregnancy of Rani,"" he said.



The couple was blessed with a second child in June 2010.

Another reason is that the state is home to 19% of all mines in India, employing over 5 lakh migrant workers. Also, everyday 25,000 truckers travel through Rajasthan.

So far, there is little clinical experience or treatment knowledge about the other type of HIV . In the absence of clear protocols from the National Aids Control Organization (Naco), most clinicians are groping in the dark about the treatment regime to be followed.There is an equal amount of confusion in diagnosis for want of appropriate testing kits. While both HIV- 1 and 2 have similar modes of transmission and could cause similar opportunistic infections, the latter takes longer to manifest.Studies abroad have shown how people have lived near normal lives for decades without showing any symptoms of illness . However, mothers infected with pure HIV-2 can pass on the infection to their newborns. ""Presently, we have nothing very effective to deal with that,"" said a Naco official who did not wish to be named.In Mumbai, the Anti-Retroviral Treatment (ART) centre at JJ Hospital, earlier headed by Dr Alaka Deshpande, was the first to detect HIV-2 infections, document and treat the cases in the city. ""In the last one year, we have diagnosed around 140 patients with HIV-2 ,"" said Deshpande . She insisted that it was high time the government took cognizance of HIV-2 and start actively studying and monitoring it. ""We are facing a situation where patients could develop resistance ,"" she added.A study undertaken by doctors at BYL Nair Hospital between January 2007 and December 2009 showed that 140 out of 42,961 patients had HIV-2 infection . Of these, 90 were exclusively HIV-2 infected, whereas the remaining 59 clients were co-infected with HIV- 1 and 2.The Naco official said efforts to understand HIV-2 have begun .

Although official statistics say that out of a total of over 17,664 samples screened till date, only about 80 cases were positive, a little more than 10 were full-blown AIDS cases and a few deaths wer e reported, this could be the tip of the iceberg.In fact, there is also a feeling that the state government is still denying that AIDS is an ‘issue’ in the state. Only the families of people who have suffered from AIDS and felt the pain and trauma related to the disease seem to understand that the disease poses a big threat.A rapid assessment survey conducted by the United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP), the Regional Office for South Asia (ROSA) a few years ago suggested that out of some 320 sample of drug users interviewed in Shillong, 11%, i.e. 36 were female. Only a small number out of those surveyed indicated that they were at risk of acquiring and transmitting the HIV virus, the survey report said, adding the majority perceived no possibility of contacting HIV.Senior officials at the Indian Red Cross Association, Shillong branch, said the campaign hoped to encourage people to address the vulnerability of women and girls to HIV. “Equality for women helps fight AIDS, it needs to be asserted,” said an official.Moreover, lack of economic alternatives where women are forced into flesh trade, lower literacy rate, limited access to information and appropriate health care services places women at greater risk, health officials pointed out.“In fact, to protect themselves from HIV infection, women must not only rely on their own skills, attitudes and behaviour regarding use of condoms, but also on their ability to convince their partners to use them,” an official emphasized. “Prevention strategies must address gender norms and other crucial issues in sexual decision-making, otherwise, campaigns, sensitization programmes etc would be futile,” she underscored.Meanwhile, the department of social work, Martin Luther Christian University, observed the World AIDS Day here today by organizing a poster competition.

The lawyer said that police authority was sitting tight over the complaint, and the parents were forced to approach the superintendent of police.

""HIV affected individuals face a lot of problems. We came out with this initiative so that the affected could have a space to share their common problems,"" she says.

Today, the organization conducts peer group programmes, support group activities and other joint initiatives. She says that peer group programmes help patients reconcile with the issues related to the disease. ""When everyone hears each other's story, it helps them garner a lot of emotional support,"" she explains.

""The frequent get-togethers will help people overcome the fears and myths associated. With anti-retroviral treatment (ART), an infected person can live a normal life for more than 30 years.

(Antibody is an infection-fighting protein produced by our immune system when it detects harmful substances).The hunt has begun to identify 100 volunteers belonging to a rare group of HIV infected patients who stay healthy for years without requiring life-saving antiretroviral treatment (ART). These antibodies in their blood are the ones that bars HIV from entering their blood cells and replicating, thereby progressing to AIDS.Scientists say these antibodies would ultimately reveal the Achilles heel of the virus and help create the elusive vaccine. This is part of International Aids Vaccine Initiative’s (IAVI) programme called Protocol G, a global hunt for such antibodies launched in 2006.So far, blood samples of 1,800 such HIV patients have been screened across 12 countries and 19 broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAbs) have been identified. A bNAb is an antibody capable of stopping a variety of HIV subtypes from infecting their target cells.“Only a minority of people who are infected with HIV produce bNAbs. Although HIV is a wildly mutable virus, certain parts of it are relatively resistant to change. These parts are essential to the virus’s ability to infect, and they are the elements of HIV that bNAbs target,” experts said.Just a few weeks ago, department of biotechnology (DBT) cleared the proposal to roll out Protocol G in the country. It is being implemented by IAVI and YRG Care from Chennai – the same organization that isolated the first HIV case in India in 1986.The blood samples collected from the 100 volunteers will be tested at Translational Health Sciences and Technology Institute (THSTI), which is being built in Gurgaon.IAVI’s India chief Dr Rajat Goyal told TOI that “This is a landmark project for India. We are presently identifying volunteers, who are at least 18 years, infected with HIV at least three years ago but has not received ART. By April, samples will be picked up and tested against a standard panel of HIV isolates by the end of 2012. We will then know whether there is a population of interest from whom these bNAb can be identified and characterized.”Careful study of bNAbs is expected to reveal vulnerabilities of the different types of HIV. Most importantly, scientists expect that they can use information about how bNAbs bind to HIV to construct immunogens — the active ingredients of vaccines — that elicit similar antibodies. The more such antibodies researchers have in hand, the more clues they can get about how best to target HIV with a vaccine.The project has tested HIV patients in Thailand , the UK, the US, Nigeria, South Africa Kenya , Australia and Zambia to identify bNAbs.HIV infects 7,100 people daily. The quest to develop an AIDS vaccine has consumed scientists for 25 years since the discovery of HIV. Scientists say HIV is the most mutable virus ever encountered. A number of different subtypes of the virus, known as clades, circulate in different regions of the world. Within those clades there is considerable variability, and, beyond that, the virus mutates furiously within the people it has infected.Second, because no one is known to have cleared an HIV infection, scientists do not know which elements of the immune response must be engaged to control the virus — and thus are uncertain how to replicate such responses.The immune system has a very narrow window of opportunity in which to neutralize HIV before the virus establishes a lifelong infection.","['hiv', 'elusive', 'volunteers', 'create', 'blood', 'vaccine', 'virus', 'fray', 'bnabs', 'tested', 'scientists', 'antibodies', 'antibody', 'india']","NEW DELHI: Could an antibody from the blood of an Indian HIV patient help create the elusive HIV vaccine ?

National AIDS Control Organisation’s latest figures show that besides high risk populations like sex workers, the highest burden of HIV is among migrants — 3.6%, which is 10 times the HIV prevalence among the general population.With migration rates increasing, the prevalence will only get worse. According to the 2001 census, 30.1% of the population was considered to have migrated (314 million) — a considerable increase from 27.4% in 1991. NACO has, therefore, identified 108 railway stations – which are both source and destination of migrants travelling in search of work. These are now the focus of the country’s anti-HIV fight.Red Ribbon Express (RRE), which chugs out of Delhi on Thursday, will stop at most of these 108 identified stations to test migrants for HIV besides carrying out counselling and spreading anti-HIV messages. During it’s year-long journey, RRE will traverse through 23 states, cover 30,000 km and stop at 162 stations.Speaking to TOI, a NACO official said, “Migrants are one of the major focus areas this time with the RRE. Last year, RRE stopped at 152 stations and reached out to 8 million people directly. This time, around 30-40 stops will be to mainly address migrants.”NACO has identified 122 districts with high out-migration across 11 states which are on priority for starting up community level interventions. Another 75 important transit locations have been identified across these 122 districts from where these migrants usually board long distance trains/buses to reach their destinations.Studies on the relationship between migration and HIV conducted by NACO in three popular migration corridors — Ganjam-Surat, Darbhanga-Delhi and Azamgarh-Mumbai — threw up shocking findings. It showed that two to four times more number of informal workers had non-regular partners or visited sex workers with only 25% using condoms. Around 5% male migrants and 13% female migrants reported sexually transmitted infections, nearly double the national average.According to NACO, the risk of HIV infection for migrants seems to arise from a multitude of factors -- risky behaviour, lack of social and economic security and involvement in peer driven risk taking activities.In a recent study by UNDP (through Population Council), the risk of HIV among migrants was reported to be 1.68 times more likely than non-migrants. Majority of migrants are also often poorly educated, with majority reporting less than five years of formal education. This contributes to limited knowledge of HIV transmission A study conducted in 30 villages in the northern parts of Karnataka revealed that 40% of single men and 35% of married migrant men had non-marital sexual relationships in the last 12 months.For a long time, India has lived with the belief that migrants are at risk only at destination sites when they are away from home and their spouse. However, recent evidence proves otherwise. Returned migrants continue to fuel the epidemic since most infected migrants tend to return to source when they are sick.A study of married men found returned migrants were 3.86 times as likely to be HIV positive as compared to active married migrant men. Among men reporting sex with a non-spousal unpaid female sex partner in the past year, only 19% of men reported consistent condom use. This impacts the women and spouses of informal workers/migrants at the source, making them vulnerable to infections from their husband.RRE has been recognized as the world’s largest mass mobilization drive on HIV. Last year, around 80 lakh people were reached through the train and outreach activities.Around 81,000 district resource persons were trained, 36,000 people got themselves tested for HIV and 28,000 people received general health check-up services.Impact assessment of RRE indicated that the comprehensive knowledge of routes of HIV transmission, methods of prevention, condom use, STI prevention and treatment was significantly higher among respondents exposed to the RRE project compared to those not exposed.","['hiv', 'rre', 'sex', 'naco', 'general', 'identified', 'migrants', 'population', 'migration', 'risk', 'men', 'times', 'prevalent']","National AIDS Control Organisation’s latest figures show that besides high risk populations like sex workers, the highest burden of HIV is among migrants — 3.6%, which is 10 times the HIV prevalence among the general population.With migration rates increasing, the prevalence will only get worse.

NG Ganar, MLC from the Teachers' Constituency, said, ""It is the government's job to help these students and also to frame some strict laws regarding their privacy so that they are not discriminated in school.""

He adds that the statistics regarding students have been sourced from various government reports. ""There have been incidents where students are refused admission, expelled or ostracized within the school campus but very few of them reach the authorities. What we need is a strong law in place which will ensure that the medical history of students or their parents is not disclosed to the school management at all,"" said Ganar.

Dr Milind Mane, who has been working with HIV patients for almost two decades, said a distinction has to be made between affected and infected students. ""HIV affected students are those whose parents are or were infected with the virus. This category may also include students who themselves have been infected with HIV. We do not have medical data about how many students in the state, out of the 20,000 affected, are themselves infected. However the National Aids Control Organization (NACO) says that on an average 11 per cent of HIV affected people in the country are infected,"" said Dr. Mane.

There is currently no data available on how many HIV affected students are present in Nagpur. But the fact that discrimination in schools happens in the state has been documented by a national level advocacy group. The Centre for Advocacy and Research (CFAR) prepared a dossier on the discrimination related incidents between 2005-2010 in Maharashtra. The dossier mentions that 10 major incidents related to stigma and discrimination in schools occurred during that time period and Nagpur district is one of the regions where these incidents have occurred.

A couple of years the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) started a school exclusively for HIV affected students, but was closed down after opposition. Dr. Mane, said, ""The school was started so that these students would feel more comfortable and that would help them concentrate on their studies only. 27 students had enrolled out of which 17 were infected with HIV. Then there was strong opposition by some NGOs and politicians who said that having a separate school similar to discrimination and eventually it was shut down.""

The civic body however denies any political pressure and cites enrolment figures as an issue. Ram Dongarwar, education officer, said, ""Students affected by HIV were chosen from various civic schools and enrolled at this special school located near Indora Chowk. ""

However due to low enrolment figures we had to shut it down.""

MLC Ganar plans to raise the issue in the next assembly session and pressurize the government in taking some concrete steps to help HIV affected students.","['hiv', 'discrimination', 'school', 'schools', 'infected', 'kids', 'nagpur', 'incidents', 'takes', 'students', 'state', 'affected', 'mlc', 'cause']","Dr Milind Mane, who has been working with HIV patients for almost two decades, said a distinction has to be made between affected and infected students.

Shockingly, a repeat test had shown that the patient was not HIV positive, but the technician did not reveal this result.

With no framework of law governing the testing of HIV-AIDS in the country, it has become the personal responsibility of doctors to keep a check on ethical and legal issues while performing such tests.

To avoid more such tragedies in the future, members of the city branch of Indian Medical Association (IMA) met to discuss important issues related to HIV tests on Tuesday. Topics like guidelines of governing bodies regarding these tests and the difficulties faced by private practitioners when they suspect HIV positive status of a patients were discussed.

Programme officer of District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) Ganesh Parihar introduced the concept of public-private partnership in terms of counselling and testing. ""As testing is voluntary and not mandatory in India, it is of utmost importance for the person undergoing the test to give his consent for it. This consent should be based on proper information,"" he insisted.

Parihar also said that doctors who are willing to set up an Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) within their premises can avail free testing kits and training for their staff.

Renowned HIV consultant Dr Milind Bhurshundi believed that provider-initiated testing and counselling would give way to more efficient and speedy clinical decisions. ""In some cases, one consent form is used for taking consent on more than one issue. Such hidden consents can't be used for HIV testing.

,"" he said.

""After consulting all stakeholders over a period of two years, a proposed HIV bill is being prepared,"" he informed. Since these guidelines may soon turn into statutory law, he asked the doctors to be prepared for it.

""When a doctor suspects a patient is suffering from HIV, they just don't know how to handle the situation. What most of us do not realize is the fact that counselling is required even before getting someone tested. Along with passing useful information, it can also help in bringing about behavioural changes in the suspect,"" opined surgeon Dr Ajay Kate.

The Gurgaon administration has not been able to find a permanent shelter for these children, even as the south Delhi NGO they were shifted to has expressed inability to provide them with permanent accommodation. The NGO says there is not enough space and infrastructure to take them in.



The children are aged between six and 12 years, and some of them need special care as they are traumatized, said sources.



Anjali Gopalan, director of NAZ foundation— a home for HIV positive children in the capital—said they have two separate dormitories for boys and girls that can accommodate up to 25 children. “Of these, 24 beds are full. The rescued children are being kept in the room reserved for providing urgent medical aid to patients. There is lack of space, few toilets and scarcity of water among other things,” she said.The NGO director said the Gurgaon administration had requested them to accommodate the children for two days, so that they could find a suitable shelter. “Now, they are not ready to take responsibility. There has been no word from the Gurgaon administration,” Gopalan claimed.P C Meena, deputy commissioner, Gurgaon, told TOI that they are trying to arrange a permanent shelter for the children at the earliest. “In Haryana, there are no government-run homes for HIV positive children.

A source said: “The patient is yet to be started on antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV infection. Such patients are usually treated for TB at the beginning. Once they stabilize, ART is started.”TB is the commonest HIV-related opportunistic infection. An expert summed up the deadly nature of the combined infection saying that when HIV brings down immunity, TB catches up. “The two need to be dealt with in a synchronized manner. Efforts and the machinery to integrate the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) with the HIV programme need to be strengthened.”As per norm, patients received by registered TB centres are counselled to go for HIV testing and vice versa. Since HIV testing is voluntary, many give it a miss. Doctors say TB patients are often not counselled enough to understand the importance of HIV testing.According to data compiled by the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS), out of 1.01 lakh registered TB patients, only 40,202, or 39%, were referred to Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) for HIV testing in 2011 till September. Among them, 1,678 patients tested positive for HIV. In Mumbai, the prevalence of HIV among TB patients is 7-8%.Dr S S Kudalkar of MDACS said mortality among patients suffering from both infections has halved in recent years. “Till a few years ago, the mortality rate (among HIV-TB co-infection patients) was around 8%. Now it is 4%.”He said HIV patients with TB “probably have a higher risk of recurrence and death”. “At no point can these patients afford to discontinue their treatments as that could give rise to (drug) resistance.” A chest specialist said HIV clubbed with resistant TB may be tricky, but not impossible to manage. “Yes, drug interactions (in such a patient) can have more side effects, but it can be handled if the patient comes in at an early stage.”","['hiv', 'infection', 'tb', 'patients', 'testing', 'deadly', 'tuberculosis', 'xxdr', 'strain', 'patient', 'control', 'man', 'mumbai']","MUMBAI: A patient with extra-extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XXDR TB) has tested positive for HIV .

The results showed a significant improvement in the behaviour among targeted groups where NGOs were working.Most field workers had reasons to smile: condom use among female sex workers had gone up from 95.7% to 98.5%; 96.1% of gays reported using condoms during sex with commercial partners, 91% of gays reported taking HIV test in the last one year; the proportion of Injecting Drug Users (IDUs) who reported sharing needles and syringes with their partners reduced from 43.3% in the last round of BSS to 31.6% in the current round; and a lesser number of truckers (28.5%) reported seeking services of commercial sex workers when compared to earlier survey (45.1%).But there is still a need for improvement.

This scheme was intended for only those living below the poverty line.In addition, APSACS said that concessional bus passes were also being provided to these patients to visit ART centres at least twice in a month.
More than 2,500 patients in Krishna district will receive pensions."

The incident came to light after Valli (42), (name changed), the boy's mother went to the drop-in centre run by Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) to seek help from B V Babu, president of the Madurai Network of Positive People.

Speaking to TOI, Valli (42), who is also an HIV+ said, ""I fell sick about two years ago and blood reports revealed that I tested positive for the deadly virus. I have been on medication ever since,"" she said. Surprisingly, her husband Kaliappan, a tricycle puller, elder daughter Easwari (18) and youngest son Parameswaran (10) have tested negative. Valli said that she never underwent any major blood transfusion or surgery and has no clue as to how she contracted the virus.

Valli said she had borrowed Rs 30,000 from a local papad manufacturer to meet the cost of her treatment two years ago. ""Today, this amount has increased to Rs 1 lakh. The only way I will be able to clear my debt is when my sons finish their education and get good jobs. But now, my elder son's future hangs in balance,"" she said.

Her brother, who had promised to get his son married to her eldest daughter, has now changed his mind, on coming to know of his sister's HIV status. ""I fear that my children may not be able to lead a normal life because of my disease. All I want is the society to treat them as equals,"" she said.

Her son Kathir (name changed) used to fall sick frequently and a blood test done last year had revealed that he was HIV positive. But he was not put on the ART drug as his CD4 count was 475 and the drug is given to patients only when their CD4 dips below 350, said Babu.

Kathir looks puny and thin compared to his younger brother who also studies in the same school. ""We were asked to pay Rs eight each for a blood test to identify our blood groups for the ID card. The teacher asked me if I was under treatment for any specific disease and asked me to bring my booklet,"" he said.

Babu says that this is a clear violation of human rights. ""I think the laboratory, which tested the boys may have suspected something and asked the school to verify details,"" he said. The boy said that the teacher started discriminating against him soon after perusing the tiny notebook which contained details about his treatment.

Meanwhile, the boy's younger brother also stayed away from school as one of the teachers had allegedly told him to ensure that his brother did not come to school from Monday onwards. ""My brother had been sitting alone in one corner of the classroom and the boys in my class are asking me why,"" he said.

When The Times of India contacted the district elementary education officer M K T Subhashini, she said that the issue had been taken up with the school's administration. However, the school authorities had denied the allegations and had told her that he did not attend school as he was sick.","['hiv', 'positive', 'asked', 'school', 'blood', 'valli', 'asks', 'tested', 'boys', 'away', 'boy', 'son', 'stay', 'madurai', 'brother']","MADURAI: A primary school in Keela Sandhaipettai on Monday resorted to the extreme step of stopping a 12-year-old boy from coming to school after one of the teachers discovered that he was HIV positive, his distraught mother has claimed.

They were demanding a white paper on the pact and wide consultation with stakeholders before implementation. The rally with protesters carrying giant inflated medicine pills was held from Mandi House to Parliament Street around 10 am.

The support group for people with HIV AIDS, including the Delhi Network of Positive People and Médecins Sans Frontières — an international, independent organization for medical humanitarian aid — claimed that certain clauses in the deal like ‘intellectual property enhancements’ and ‘data exclusivity’ could effectively block the production of generic drugs by Indian companies.“Millions of patients in poor countries, many in Africa, are unable to pay sky-high Western prices to treat illnesses that include HIV, malaria, asthma and cancer. For HIV alone, India makes more than 80% of the world’s medicines,” said Leena Menghaney from MSF.She said that two broad provisions in the agreement — one on intellectual property rights and the other on investor lawsuits — would make it much easier for international pharmaceutical giants to sue the Indian government, drug manufacturers and distributors. It will curtail production of many lifesaving drugs, or cause prices to increase to levels many cannot afford, said Menghaney.Kavaljit Singh, director, Madhyam said due to competition among generics producers in India, the price of first-line HIV medicines has dropped by more than 99%, from US$10,000 per person per year in 2000 to roughly $150 presently. “This significant price decrease has supported the massive expansion of HIV treatment worldwide: more than 80% of the HIV medicines used to treat 6.6 million people in developing countries come from Indian producers, and 90% of pediatric HIV medicines are Indian-produced. MSF and other treatment providers also use Indian generic medicines to treat other diseases and conditions,” he said. The activists demanded that the government make the details of the agreement being discussed public and hold wide consultations before giving any final approval to the same. “Public view must be considered,” said Biraj Patnaik, principal adviser to the commissioners of the Supreme Court on the Right to Food.","['medicines', 'hiv', 'property', 'protest', 'patients', 'indian', 'drugs', 'costlier', 'agreement', 'public', 'wide', 'treat', 'treatment', 'india']","NEW DELHI: Hundreds of HIV-positive people staged a march in the city on Friday to protest against the free trade agreement between the European Union and India.

For more than three months, patients are struggling without treatment as the first line of therapy is not effective to keep the viral load under control.The problem has compounded for patients as the JJ Hospital’s Centre of Excellence remains one of the nodal centres in the state to screen and select patients for second line of anti-retroviral therapy (ART).Patients who become resistant to the first line of ART treatment, and have a viral load of more than 5,000 copies per millilitre, have to be started on the second line. Patients are also dependant on the free second line ART treatment as it could cost about Rs 10,000 in a month.A medical source told TOI said the problems started soon after former ART in-charge Dr Alaka Deshpande quit in November 2011. “Monthly meetings, which were held to select patients after their viral load examinations were done, just stopped. Without those meetings the patients could not be selected,” said a JJ Hospital source.Dr BB Rewari, National Aids Control Organization (NACO) ART consultant, said, “There was no new doctor trained to replace the previous nodal person. The new team headed by Dr V K Joglekar has requested us to sensitize them about the ART. We will be doing that soon.” he said.

Nagpur will also have another centre soon for second line therapy,” he said.However, some doctors at JJ Hospital defended themselves by saying that lack of training alone should not be blamed for the delay.“The testing facility to check viral load had stopped, however tests have resumed,” said one of the doctors. Sources told TOI that medical kits required for testing viral load were out of stock, and so the laboratory at Kasturba Hospital could not carry out the tests.Red Ribbon, an AIDS/HIV awareness train, will be parked at CST on Wednesday and Thursday.

Overall, HIV prevalence in FSWs was found to be 12%.In 26 countries deemed to have medium or high background HIV prevalence, some 31% of FSWs were HIV- positive, and were 12 times more likely to be infected than women from the general population.“We identified consistent evidence of substantially higher levels of HIV among FSWs compared with all women of reproductive age in low and middle-income countries in all regions with data,” the authors said.“These findings suggest an urgent need to scale up access to quality HIV-prevention programming and services among FSWs because of their heightened burden of disease and likelihood of onward transmission through high numbers of sexual partners as clients. Improvement of linkages to antiretroviral treatment and retention in care is crucial. The role of stigma, discrimination and violence targeting female sex workers globally will be required to reduce the disproportionate disease burden among these women,” they added.“When reviewing the data from the past five years, FSWs still carry more than a 50-time increased odds of HIV infection in India. Since HIV prevalence is a lagging indicator of prevention success, time is needed to reveal the benefit of these programmes in terms of the absolute burden of HIV among female sex workers in India. Nonetheless, the disproportionate burden of HIV among these sex workers, even in settings where progressive programmes exist, emphasizes the need to increase coverage by increasing scale of prevention programmes and decreasing barriers to access,” is how The Lancet summed about the situation in India.In India, women account for around one million out of 2.5 million estimated number of people living with HIV/AIDS. The National Aids Control Organization estimates that around 4.9% of FSWs in India are HIV- positive.The estimated number of new annual HIV infections has declined by more than 50% over the past decade. India had about 1.2 lakh new HIV infections in 2009 as against 2.7 lakh in 2000.While this trend is evident in most states, some low prevalence states have shown an increase in the number of new infections over the past two years. Of the 1.2 lakh estimated new infections in 2009, the six high-prevalence states account for only 39% of the cases, while states like Odisha, Bihar, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat account for 41% of new infections.The adult HIV prevalence at national level has continued its steady decline from estimated level of 0.41% in 2000 through 0.36% in 2006 to 0.31% in 2009. In India, about 40% people don’t even know their HIV status.The prevalence of HIV among key population at higher risk of infection – notably sex workers, people who inject drugs and men who have sex with men – is high in several Asian countries. However, the virus is spreading to other sections of the population through the years.","['hiv', 'fsws', 'suffering', 'workers', 'sex', 'states', 'women', 'prevalence', 'countries', 'infections', 'female', 'india']","The role of stigma, discrimination and violence targeting female sex workers globally will be required to reduce the disproportionate disease burden among these women,” they added.“When reviewing the data from the past five years, FSWs still carry more than a 50-time increased odds of HIV infection in India.

""I was shunned by everybody, including the hospital staff treating me, due to my HIV status. But after the test last week, they have started touching me again,"" said Hadibandhu Sahoo, who has been undergoing treatment for a broken spine.

Sahoo had tested HIV positive in April 2011 at Swami Vivekanad National Institute of Rehabilitation Training and Research, an institute of the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment in Cuttack district.

Sahoo, who hails from Ghantapada village in Angul district, used to work as a security guard in a biscuit manufacturing company in Bhuj, Gujarat. He had broken his spine during the 2001 Gujarat earthquake and underwent a series of treatment at various health centres. His spine, however, refused to heal and he was finally admitted to the Vivekanad National Institute for treatment from April to June 2011, where he was diagnosed HIV positive.

TOI had highlighted his plight in an article published on July 6, 2011. ""I was discharged from the hospital in August and started a paan shop in Talcher with the help of the local MLA. However, people who knew my HIV status would avoid the shop,"" he said.

The 50-year-old wheelchair-bound man had to be admitted to Capital Hospital when he injured his back again recently after he slipped and fell while taking a bath. In a fresh test conducted at the Integrated Counelling and Testing Centre (ICTC) at Capital Hospital, Sahoo was found to be HIV negative last week.

""The recent fall was a blessing in disguise for me. I have got a new lease of life after the fresh diagnosis. I had started cursing my life earlier,"" said Sahoo, adding, ""Last time when I was hospitalized, nobody would come near me because of my HIV positive status. Now finally I am being treated as a normal person.""

When contacted, the hospitals defended the test reports. ""We rely on the rapid test kits supplied by National AIDS Control Organisation, which has a margin of error,"" said R N Mohanty, director in-charge of Vivekanad National Institute.

Capital Hospital authorities said the ICTC test is a confirmatory test. ""I can't comment about test done elsewhere but ICTC tests are regarded confirmatory.

An ongoing study at JJ Hospital’s gynaecology department, for instance, is looking at fertility and reproductive desires of HIV-positive people.“We are studying if men and women who have been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS understand the emotional, social and financial implications of having a child,” said Dr Rekha Daver, who heads the gynaecology department. The fiveyear-long study, which is being done jointly with the Indian Council for Medical Research, started last year. The idea is to develop a better counselling mechanism for HIV-positive people. Incidentally, the National AIDS Control Organisation has recognised JJ Hospital’s gynaecology department as a Centre of Excellence in the Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission of HIV/AIDS programme.“We have delivered 1,073 HIVpositive women in the last 11 years. We have also managed to control mother-to-child transmission of HIV to a great deal. In fact, of the last 100 deliveries, 95 children are free of the virus,’’ said Dr Daver.Considering the number of HIVpositive people who come to JJ Hospital , it’s not surprising that the fertility desire study is being done here. “The study involves hours of intense counselling, taking down notes and a check-up . We have finished interviewing around 20 people so far,’’ said Dr Daver.She added patients usually say having a child is their ultimate dream. “Social pressure as well as the woman’s own mental makeup contributes to this decision,” said Dr Daver. Every pregnant woman who comes to JJ Hospital’s gynaecology department is counselled and voluntarily tested for HIV. They are informed of the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and possibility of the children becoming AIDS orphans. “But many still want their biological babies,” she said.A Harvard University study a few years back noted that “spousal, family, community and cultural influences greatly shape HIV-positive women’s desire to become pregnant. Studies in India , South Africa, Taiwan and Vietnam have demonstrated the weight of culture-specific spousal and family wishes that a woman will need to consider besides her own desires and HIV status.”Dr Daver added many HIV-positive women opt for pregnancy as they are worried about discrimination in society if they are childless.“HIV-positive women have as much social problems as medical issues,’’ she said.","['positive', 'hiv', 'having', 'study', 'hivpositive', 'jj', 'child', 'women', 'transmission', 'gynaecology', 'dr', 'department', 'social']","Incidentally, the National AIDS Control Organisation has recognised JJ Hospital’s gynaecology department as a Centre of Excellence in the Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission of HIV/AIDS programme.“We have delivered 1,073 HIVpositive women in the last 11 years.

An AIDS patient cannot be denied employment or sacked except with a written assessment of an independent healthcare provider that the person poses a risk of transmission of virus to others at the workplace.

These are some of the path-breaking provisions in a law drafted by the government that provides for stiff punishment for discrimination against those who are HIV-positive and for propagating hatred against the victims of the infection.The ‘new deal’ for a stigmatized group that is often condemned twice is in the final stage of approval with the Centre finalizing the long-pending HIV-AIDS (Prevention & Control) Bill that was caught in differences between ministries of law and health. It lays down inviolable rights for patients and stringent duties for individuals and institutions dealing with them.

HIV test not must for getting jobs, proposes bill

The proposed law states that testing for AIDS cannot be a pre-requisite for employment or for access to healthcare, education or public places. It would mean that HIV afflicted people refused entry to public places like hotels or restaurants or denied purchase or renting of house can move an ombudsman. They can also move courts against discrimination.



Also, a person with HIV virus cannot be sacked or denied employment except with a written assessment of a qualified and independent healthcare provider that the afflicted person indeed poses risks of transmission.



Any person below 18 years of age and a woman of any age will have the right to live in a shared property, as a safeguard against eviction due to stigma. The medical costs will be factored in during any maintenance settlements. This can help women in divorce cases.



The law would put in place a National Authority in the form of a Department of AIDS Control (NACO), which will formulate guidelines and rules for protocols like treatment of HIV patients through Anti-Retroviral Therapy or rules for blood banks or diagnostic centres.



An ombudsman in every state, as the forum to adjudicate violations under the law, would help the aggrieved to avoid time-consuming legal proceedings in civil courts.



The law seeks to deter rampant victimization of HIV-positive persons. A key clause prescribes a jail term of three months to two years for any spoken or written word, or display of information or advertisement, which could expose HIV-positive persons to any form of hostility. This can also lead to a fine up to Rs one lakh.



The inviolable right of an HIV person, as part of the first-ever codification of rights and duties, may help patients who face subtle or overt discrimination with no forum for grievance redressal.



The law asserts no person can be forced to take an HIV test. For such a test, the authority would have to secure consent after due counseling on all pros and cons. Similarly, no HIV-positive person can be subjected to medical treatment without his consent – a decision which should be made after he has been informed about the risks and benefits of the treatment.



A judicial order would be the only exception to force an AIDS test on a person apart from “screening purpose” in a blood bank.The HIV positive persons would finally enjoy guaranteed confidentiality. No person can be compelled to disclose his HIV status (except under a court directive). In a strict deterrent, the law states that if a person reveals the identity of an HIV-positive, as information that is passed on as part of legal proceedings, he could face a fine of up to Rs 1 lakh.To balance the threat of transmission with stringent non-disclosure law, a doctor can disclose his patient’s HIV-positive status to his partner if he believes there is a risk of infection. However, he would have to guard against such disclosure about a woman if there is apprehension that it can lead to her being abandoned or facing violence.The ombudsman can impose an initial fine of Rs 10,000, and thereafter Rs 5,000 a day for non-compliance of orders.To ensure that non-discrimination clause of Act is followed at workplace, every institution with over 100 employees would have to appoint a senior officer to deal with violations of the law.","['discrimination', 'hiv', 'aids', 'hivinfected', 'patients', 'hivpositive', 'test', 'person', 'strict', 'law', 'persons', 'covering', 'written', 'rs', 'soon']","HIV test not must for getting jobs, proposes billThe proposed law states that testing for AIDS cannot be a pre-requisite for employment or for access to healthcare, education or public places.

The men had allegedly said that they would not allow the body to be buried unless his relatives settled the amount immediately.

The deceased, Gnana Arockiam (38) was working as a load man at Malaithathampatti in Manapparai and had contracted the HIV virus six years ago. Father of two children, Arockiam was undergoing treatment at the Trichy Government Hospital. When his wife came to know that her husband had contracted HIV, she left for her ancestral home at Pothamettupetti along with their children.

Meanwhile, loneliness coupled with the presence of the disease made Arockiam's life miserable and he attempted suicide on Wednesday by jumping into a well in Malaithathampatti. On getting information, the Manapparai station fire officer rushed to the well and saved Arockiam. He was admitted to the Trichy GH but breathed his last on Wednesday night.

The study demonstrates for the first time that engineering stem cells to form immune cells that target HIV is effective in suppressing the virus in living tissues in an animal model, said lead scientist Scott G Kitchen. He added: “We believe that this study lays the groundwork for the potential use of this type of an approach in combating HIV infection in infected individuals , in hopes of eradicating the virus from the body.”



In their previous research, the scientists took CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes — the “killer” T cells that help fight infection — from an HIV-infected individual and identified the molecule known as the T cell receptor, which guides T cell in recognizing and killing HIV-infected cells.

In their latest research, the scientists at California University similarly engineered human blood stem cells and found that they can form mature T cells that can attack HIV in tissues where the virus resides and replicates.They did so by using a surrogate model, the humanized mouse, in which HIV infection closely resembles the disease and its progression in humans . In a series of tests on the mice’s peripheral blood, plasma and organs conducted two weeks and six weeks after introducing the engineered cells, the scientists found that the number of CD4 “helper” T cells — which become depleted as a result of HIV infection — increased, while levels of HIV in the blood decreased.CD4 cells are white blood cells that are an important component of immune system , helping to fight off infections . These results indicated that the engineered cells were capable of developing and migrating to the organs to fight infection there, the ‘PLoS Pathogens’ journal reported.“We believe that this is the first step in developing a more aggressive approach in correcting the defects in the human T cell responses that allow HIV to persist in infected people,” Kitchen said.","['hiv', 'stem', 'blood', 'human', 'virus', 'cells', 'scientists', 'hunt', 'fight', 'engineered', 'tweaked', 'infection', 'kill']","WASHINGTON: In a major breakthrough in the fight against AIDS, scientists claim to have for the first time shown that human stem cells can be genetically engineered to seek out and kill HIV-infected cells in a living organism.

The woman from Banapur area of Khurda district said she and her 28-year-old husband had undergone HIV test in the hospital on April 11. ""While he tested negative, I was found positive. He left me and our daughter in the hospital after that. He is not even attending to my phone calls,"" she said.

The woman and her husband, who works as a wall painter in Bangalore, had come to the hospital because of their daughter's illness on April 10. The child had developed intermittent fever and lost weight.

Doctors in Capital Hospital suggested an HIV test on her. The integrated counseling and testing centre (ICTC) in the hospital, however, advised the parents to undergo the test since the girl was too small. After the ICTC revealed the results, the man abandoned the mother and the daughter. The girl is recuperating in the pediatric ward while her mother is attending on her.

""I waited for two days but he did not turn up. I called up my mother and brother after that,"" she said. ""I am shocked because he is otherwise a dotting husband and took care of us very well.""

The woman's brother said when he and some relatives went to meet her husband, the man hurled abuses at them. When contacted over phone by TOI, the husband said, ""You must be knowing why I did this? I had to leave.""

Capital Hospital authorities described the development as a social problem. ""It is an unfortunate development. There is need for greater awareness so that people don't shy away from owning up a HIV+ kin,"" said hospital's deputy medical superintendent Dr S N Swain.

Family sources said the woman after her delivery in Banapur hospital in November was referred to Khurda district headquarters hospital because of profuse bleeding.

Case 1:

Unable to cope with his rapidly falling health, the lad just stopped taking medicines and finally committed suicide a few days back.Along with being HIV positive, these two men had another thing in common - both of them were closet gays and hadn't declared their sexuality to their families. So, what needs to be done to contain these suicides in the gay community? We try to find the answers…Film director Onir of films like I AM and My Brother Nikhil fame, who's openly declared his sexuality, says: ""It's the burden of dealing with the dual stigma (of homosexuality and HIV), which proves to be their undoing. Gays won't reveal their sexuality without fear till the time Supreme Court gives a ruling in their favour. Meanwhile, sex education will go a long way in educating them about safe sex. Parents ' support can safeguard them against societal cruelty and mockery, which eggs them on to take the ultimate step. They must not force their kids to get married against their wish. It is enough that their child is happy with a partner of his own choice. This acceptance can lessen such sad incidents!""According to Prince Manvendra Singh , India’s first gay royal to declare his sexuality, being a part of a support group goes a long way in lessening the psychological burden of HIV-inflicted gays. ""If they interact regularly with like-minded people and share their fears, their goals and their woes with other HIV-positive people, they feel much better and stronger from within. But, if they remain closet gays, nobody can help them. There's nobody to hold their hand and wipe their tears when danger signals appear,"" says he.

Speak about it!

Anand Chandrani, the founder president of an NGO dedicated to gays and transgenders, says, ""Kumar couldn't cope up with the fact that he was leading dual life. And when he learnt that he was HIV positive, he just couldn't bear the pressure of multiple trauma. There are many others in our community, who need slightest trigger to commit suicide.

‘I tried to commit suicide thrice’Sundar (name changed), 25""Two years back, I learnt that I was HIV positive, and tried to commit suicide thrice since then. But, whenever I went to jump into a well, the faces of my parents would come in front of me, and I would step back. My parents are now pressurising me to get married, and I am scared of telling them about my homosexuality, as I’m already trying to cope with my HIV.""‘My mom’s support helps me’Tarun (name changed), 23""I have known for the past four years that I'm HIV positive. Last year, I told my mom about it and she was shocked initially. But now, she's become my biggest support and that helps. Hope, some day I can gather enough guts to tell her about my homosexuality too!""'I'm scared my wife will leave me'Sonu (name changed), 31""I'm married and have a two-year-old daughter too. Barely 15 days back, I learnt about my HIV status and was scared to death. On, the counsellor's advice, I had to tell my wife about it.

I don't think I will be able to tell her about my homosexuality now because I'm scared that she’ll leave me!""","['hiv', 'positive', 'homosexuality', 'hivpositive', 'changed', 'suicide', 'tell', 'rampant', 'support', 'sexuality', 'scared', 'gays']","On Friday, an HIV-positive gay committed suicide, which was second such death in April.

""I have lived my life. But my child is about to bloom. After all relatives having washed their hands of her care, I don't know how she will live and who will power her dreams and shape her future."" The state of children living with HIV/AIDS (CLHA) is growing grim, with more than 400 such children waiting for someone to make their lives a bit easier.

Ragini is passionate about dancing and whenever the song 'Ata jau dya na ghari' is played, her legs just begin to tap and she loses herself in the music. ""I go to school at Nashik Road. I don't remember my mother, who died when I was one. My father died when I was nine. I know I have the disease, but also know that I can fight it,"" said Ragini.

Similar is the fate of 12-year-old visually impaired CLHA, Ankush, who lives in a slum in Satpur. Ankush loves to play the keyboard and other instruments. He lost his father three years back to AIDS and his mother Sangeeta, also HIV positive, is terminally ill. Sangeeta hopes that the government will raise some shelter system for such children. ""Having acquired AIDS from their spouse, women are the worst hit. They lose their husband, their own life and also are unable to see their kids living happily. At least if there is an arrangement for the well-being of the kids, we can be at peace,"" Sangeeta said.

The government, on its own part, cannot allow any such facility, as this would mean discriminating against the ill-fated children, who are the victims in this whole vicious circle. ""The government has no scheme to promote a separate facility for HIV positive persons as it would amount to discrimination,"" said a senior official from the health department, adding that instead, the government was ready to fund all the medical aid required by the patients.

But such means are found insufficient when it comes to the lives of CLHA, once their parents or grandparents pass away. Mahindra and Mahindra along with Yash Foundation has started an HIV/AIDS awareness programme and is working on the rehabilitation of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) and support to CLHAs. ""For the last three years, we have been providing nutritional support to more than 150 CLHAs, monitoring their health and even giving them medical support whenever required. But unfortunately, we do not have a residential system for the children,"" said Jitendra Patil, rehabilitation manager, Yash Foundation.

This is the time when the need of such arrangement is required the most. In the field of medical inventions, medicos have found solutions such that even HIV-positive parents can give birth to a normal child. ""The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) could serve the purpose by raising an 'educational hostel' facility for the short span of twenty years from today. Here, even normal children could also be admitted. The children could go home during the weekends,"" Patil suggested.

Exhibition with a cause

Mahindra and Mahindra, along with Yash Foundation is trying to raise funds to help reach more number of CLHAs in the district. In one such drive, they had organized a 'Taarein Zameen Par' programme on January 26, where renowned artists Shivaji Tupe, Anand Sonar and Dnyanesh Belekar from Nashik, with students from the Arts stream created a large number of paintings, which have now been put for auction from April 30 to May 2 at Sadhana Art Gallery, Deepali Nagar, from 11am to 8pm.

Speaking as chief guest on the International AIDS Candlelight Memorial observation here on Sunday, he lauded the role played by HIV positive people and drug users in leading the struggle for protection of rights and decreasing the spread of the HIV epidemic.

Manipur is one of the six states in the country with widespread prevalence of HIV/AIDS.

""The draft state AIDS policy needs to be tabled at the earliest and discussed threadbare so that our response to the epidemic is in tune with the needs of the community.

This has come to light with the proper functioning of government's HIV test centre in the district.

Although the rise in number of HIV cases is a matter of concern for the common man, the district health department is looking at it in a positive manner. ""This will not only help the HIV positive person to avail better and free treatment but also stop transmission of HIV to others,"" said an official.

In last two years the official figure of HIV positive cases was put at 22. Till 2010, eleven persons, including pregnant women and children, were found to be HIV positive in the tests conducted at the government's Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) run by State AIDS Control Society.

Year-wise detection of HIV positive cases in the district for last three years on an average stands at five. The ICTC was opened in Lohardaga in 2008. Only one one HIV positive case was detected that year. Later detection of HIV positive cases increased. While in 2009 three such cases were detected. The number increased to seven in 2010, five were detected in 2011 and sixes cases have been detected so far in 2012, thereby, taking the total number since 2008 to 22.

ICTC counsellor Archna Prasad, however, is not satisfied with the number of detection of HIV positive cases in the district. According to Prasad, many more persons suffer the disease but hesitate to come to the ICTC located at the Lohardaga Sadar Hospital for tests and counseling.

""Since my centre maintains everything one needs, trust is necessary. Although people are coming for HIV tests, we still have miles to go with regard to bringing about awareness among the people and removing reservation of those affected by HIV but keeping away from the ICTC. Migration is the source of the disease and this is a major problem as it is difficult to counsel, conduct tests and offer treatment to the affected persons who live outside the state. At most times we ask relatives to encourage their family members to go for testing at their nearest ICTC where they live,"" Prasad said.

The absence of anti retro-viral therapy (ART) centre in the district is creating a problem. A 32-year-old woman found with HIV positive recently has still not started medication as she cannot travel alone. ""She is waiting for her husband, who works in Mumbai, to return. He, too, will have to undergo HIV test,"" a source said.","['hiv', 'positive', 'ictc', 'lohardaga', 'number', 'testing', 'counselling', 'detects', 'detected', 'integrated', 'cases', 'centre', 'district', 'tests']","LOHARDAGA: There has been a rise in the number of HIV positive case in Lohardaga district in recent times.

Student volunteer Max Silva, a senior in anthropology at University of Arizona, said he signed on for the programme because he wanted to do something different and help the HIV community.“At first I thought it would be tough to teach children in Chennai and that language would be a barrier,” said Silva, one of the 19 American student-volunteers in the city this year. “But, man, we are having a blast!

CBI probe has been ordered for the first time by the HC while acting on a PIL.

When the kids were found infected with HIV last year, parents and lawyers from the HC filed PIL demanding a thorough probe. The state government did not even register an FIR against erring officials. The court asked IPS officer Shobha Bhutada to probe the case, but the judges expressed disappointment at her efforts.

Transferring the probe to the CBI, the bench of acting Chief Justice Bhaskar Bhattachayra and Justice J B Pardiwala criticized Bhutada's probe and highlighted her inaction and blunders in its judgment. The judges were shocked at Bhutada's recording statement of local BJP MLA Mahendra Mashroo on the letterhead of a private blood bank, Sarvodaya Blood Bank, which faces charge of being criminally negligent in blood transfusion.

Emphasizing on inaction on part of the IPS officer, the court noted that allegations were against high level officers and the legislator, who illegally occupied space in the government hospital and he being chairman of the blood bank invaded into government's official site and all top officials were blissfully ignorant about this.

The court said that the administration saw to it that probe did not take place in proper manner, as the government was even reluctant to register an FIR. The court observed that no effective steps were taken during five months of probe and the system seemed supporting the private blood bank, which did not even have a license.

The court rejected all contentions raised by the state government.

A conference was arranged in Delhi with a panel of doctors, mostly gynaecologists or oncologists.The vaccination, which protects you from the deadly HPV virus that leads to cancer, was discussed. The initiative is called ‘Guard your Angel’. In this case, the angels are your daughters, who can get immunised after the age of nine. Although the vaccine is most effective on young girls before their ‘sexual debut’, the doctors said it could be effective right until the age of 45. Now that is something most women don’t know. The doctors answered many questions clearing the doubts of about a hundred women in the audience, a largely educated one. I can’t even begin to understand the plight of the uneducated rural women who have no idea about cervical cancer. “Don’t wait for someone to take you to the doctor, whether it is for the vaccination or the yearly screening. Get up and do it yourself,” said the doctors. Statistics show that one out of every four women affected by this kind of cancer is an Indian. It is now a bigger killer than breast cancer.‘Meri beti meri duty’ said the initiative. However, it is also our duty to live for our betis and our whole family. So while you get your daughter vaccinated after she is nine, also get yourself vaccinated if you fall below the age of 45.“Your family needs you and you have to take care of yourself” said Parminder Saini. She is a pediatrician who got affected by cervical cancer. She fought it and is back to leading the life of a doctor. “I want people not to feel sorry for me but want the affected to be inspired to fight this disease and the rest of the world to keep themselves healthy,” she said. She talked about deleting stress from our lives as much as possible, pointing to the fact that it can be one of the main causes of cancer. Practices like yoga and meditation should be a part of daily life. “Eat healthy, focusing on fruits and vegetables,” she said. “Live your life and value it.”So let’s guard our special angels.

338,21-7-2012,['Kounteya Sinha'],https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg,"NEW DELHI: Now, HIV can be tested in the privacy of your home.The US Food and Drug Administration FDA ) on Wednesday approved the first over-the-counter HIV test kit that allows people to test at home to see whether they are infected with the virus that causes AIDS.The OraQuick In-Home HIV test is designed to allow individuals to collect an oral fluid sample by swabbing the upper and lower gums inside of their mouths, then place that sample into a developer vial and obtain test results within 20-40 minutes.However, a positive result with this test does not mean that an individual is definitely infected with HIV, but rather that additional testing should be done in a medical setting to confirm the result.Similarly, a negative test result does not mean that an individual is definitely not infected with HIV, particularly when exposure may have been within the previous three months.FDA says the test has the potential to identify large numbers of previously undiagnosed HIV infections, especially if used by those unlikely to use standard screening methods.“Knowing your status is an important factor in the effort to prevent the spread of HIV,” said Karen Midthun, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “The availability of a home-use HIV test kit provides another option for individuals to get tested so that they can seek medical care, if appropriate.”However, India is not going to allow home testing of this deadly infection. India’s National AIDS Control Organization ( NACO ) told TOI that counseling patients before and after they undergo testing is vital.“If patients find themselves HIV positive by testing at home without counseling, it can push them to suffer from severe depression, make them commit suicide or lead to violence if women are found to be positive. Around 35% of all new cases of HIV in India are among women India. Such home testing kits can be allowed in countries with high infection rates in the general population and not in India where the epidemic is concentrated among high risk populations like sex workers,” said national ART officer at NACO Dr B B Rewari.Union health ministry officials said at present nearly 10,000 centres across India counsel people who undertake a HIV test. In 2011, an estimated 1.6 million people got tested for HIV. Around 2.31 million people are estimated to be HIV positive in India.“Of these, 40% don’t know that they are infected. Counseling is vital. We tell those who get tested and are found HIV positive how to lead a healthy life, how we will connect them to care, support and treatment services, put them on nutritional support and prevent further spread of the virus,” Dr Rewari added.Dr Sandhya Kabra from NACO said, whenever a patient is found to be HIV positive, the test is repeated two more times to confirm the results.“If found negative, the test isn’t repeated. But if the test gives a positive result, we repeat the test for extra confirmation. Testing without counseling can make a patient take drastic measures,” Dr Kabra said.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that there are about 50,000 new HIV infections every year. Many of these new infections are transmitted from people who are unaware of their HIV status.Clinical studies for self-testing have shown that the OraQuick In-Home HIV Test has an expected performance of 92% for test sensitivity, the percentage of results that will be positive when HIV is present. This means that one false negative result would be expected out of every 12 test results in HIV-infected individuals.Clinical studies also have shown that the OraQuick In-Home HIV Test has an expected performance of 99.98% for test specificity, the percentage of results that will be negative when HIV is not present.This means that one false positive would be expected out of every 5,000 test results in uninfected individuals.A variety of home tests finger pricks or mouth swabs are now being developed to be used by individuals to know their HIV status by sitting at home which can produce results in one-20 minutes. UNAIDS report recently said the world was opening up to home testing for HIV since fewer than half of those living with HIV knew their status. This is a huge barrier to treatment scale up.“Despite the advances in technology, testing is still approached with fear, accessing clinics is inconvenient and the experience of HIV testing is often stigmatizing. The cost of these tests is now measured in cents,” UNAIDS said.In September, 2011, the United Kingdom’s House of Lords’ select committee on AIDS recommended repealing laws that prohibit home HIV testing.","['hiv', 'positive', 'result', 'testing', 'infected', 'test', 'tested', 'negative', 'results', 'approves', 'india', 'upholds', 'privacy']","Around 2.31 million people are estimated to be HIV positive in India.“Of these, 40% don’t know that they are infected.

339,26-7-2012,['Sumitra Debroy'],https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg,"MUMBAI: An HIV scare looms large over Mumbai as regular supply of condoms, syringes and medicines to tackle the deadly virus has nearly dried up in its most vulnerable pockets. Twenty-one NGOs (non-governmental organizations) and 13 community-based organizations (CBOs) that handle a total of 52 intervention projects for the city’s population at highest risk of contacting and spreading HIV have not received central government funds since April.This blow comes at a time when already close to 60,000 of the 4.20 lakh individuals in the state afflicted with HIV are living in the city. Although its prevalence in the general population has been on a decline, the graph has only been rising for the high-risk groups.The crunch in funds has directly affected efforts made by agencies to protect an estimated 2.34 lakh high-risk individuals. They include female sex workers (FSW), transgender individuals, men having sex with men (MSM), intravenous drug users (IDU), truckers and migrants. Currently, HIV prevalence among FSW is as high as 27%, 18% in IDUs, 12% in MSM and 30% in the transgender population.Following the fund crisis, most NGOs and CBOs have been forced to downsize their workforce and a few have even completely stalled their work. Funds allocated to each project vary from Rs 9 lakh to 20 lakh, depending on its reach. Without the money, most organizations have been unable to pay their staffers, and have defaulted on the rents and electricity bills. The worst hit are some former sex workers-turned-outreach workers and -peer educators, who have had to go back to their old ways to support their families.TOI came across one such outreach worker from Malwani who said she waited for two months for her salary of Rs 7,000 to arrive. “On the third month, I had no choice but to do the only work I knew,” said the worker, who is associated with a CBO that caters to the transgender population. As an outreach worker, her job is to visit brothels to distribute condoms and inform new entrants about prevention.A Ghatkopar-based NGO told TOI that they were struggling to even purchase stationery for daily use while a south Mumbai CBO that works with MSM said they had to take huge loans to meet ends. Eldred Tellis, director of Sankalp Rehabilitation Trust , said he had to borrow approximately Rs 7.5 lakh from his trust’s buffer to sustain three IDU projects. “Though bigger NGOs can sustain for a while, smaller organizations are finding it extremely difficult to cope,” he said.Ashok Row Kavi, founder-chairperson of Humsafar Trust, also said three of his MSM projects were badly hit. “Without paying salaries, how can I expect my volunteers to be present at the site and distribute condoms everyday? This (fund crunch) has created a dent in the measures taken so far and an increase in HIV prevalence is likely,” he said.Dr Balkrishna Adsul, additional project director of Mumbai District Aids Control Society ( MDACS ), said, “The delay was from NACO’s end. But funds have arrived now and we have started disbursing it already.” He also said the crunch at the Centre could be caused by the drying up of money from global agencies. Geneva-based Global Fund (GF) had announced stoppage of funds till 2014 for diseases, including HIV, in India.Dr Neeraj Dhingra, deputy director general, NACO, said he would check how and why the crunch happened. “There is sufficient money to fund projects as long as NGOs are clear with their records,” he said.","['hiv', 'ngos', 'projects', 'dry', 'funds', 'lakh', 'fund', 'msm', 'crunch', 'organizations', 'scare', 'mumbai']","MUMBAI: An HIV scare looms large over Mumbai as regular supply of condoms, syringes and medicines to tackle the deadly virus has nearly dried up in its most vulnerable pockets.

People diagnosed with HIV that without treatment develops into AIDS take antiviral medications to control the infection that attacks their immune system.In a statement, the FDA stressed that the drug should be used as part of a ""comprehensive HIV prevention plan"", including condom use and regular HIV testing. Studies show that Truvada reduced the risk of HIV in healthy gay men - and among HIV-negative heterosexual partners of HIV-positive people - by between 44% and 73%.""In the 80s and early 90s, HIV was viewed as a life-threatening disease; in some parts of the world it still is. Medical advances, along with the availability of close to 30 approved individual HIV drugs, have enabled us to treat it as a chronic disease most of the time,"" Debra Birnkrant, director of the Division of Antiviral Products at FDA, said.GM bacteria prevents malaria transmissionIn a breakthrough, US scientists have genetically modified a bacterium to kill the parasite that causes malaria before it infects humans. Researchers at Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute said their breakthrough could help prevent mosquitoes from transmitting malaria to humans. Malaria kills over 800,000 people worldwide every year, most of them are children.In the new study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers modified the bacterium, called Pantoea agglomerans, to secrete proteins that are toxic to the malaria parasite, but not harmful to the mosquito or humans. The bacterium is commonly found in the mosquito's midgut. It was found that the modified bacteria were 98 per cent effective in reducing the malaria parasite burden in the insects, the researchers said.","['hiv', 'pill', 'cut', 'researchers', 'modified', 'humans', 'risk', 'malaria', 'drug', 'fda', 'parasite', 'nod', 'infection', 'onceaday']","WASHINGTON: For the first time, a once-a-day pill which reduces the chance of contracting HIV among high risk groups ""significantly"" has got green signal in the US, where 1.2 million people are infected by the deadly disease.

Earlier this week, the Food and Drug Administration approved a daily pill, Truvada, which reduces the risk of HIV infection.A team of researchers from the University of Nebraska Medical Center is progressing towards developing weekly or twice-monthly injectable antiretroviral therapy (ART) nanomedicines for patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.A long-acting, nanoformulated ART (nanoART) would be a substantive improvement over daily and sometimes more complex regimen of pills , lead investigator on the development of nanoART for HIV/AIDS and professor and chairman of the department of pharmacology and experimental neuroscience (PEN) at UNMC, Howard Gendelman, MD, said.A journal article hails the successful testing of UNMC’s ART injectables as treatment of HIV-infected mice and in preventing new infections.“We actually followed the process exactly as we would with a person – and it worked,” Dr. Gendelman said.“This is all very exciting. Although there are clear pitfalls ahead and the medicines are not yet ready for human use, the progress is undeniable.”Dr. Gendelman said one of the project’s real advantages is in the nanoformulations.“NanoART is cell directed. So when you take a pill, the pill travels throughout the body indiscriminately. In these nanomedicines, you can use the body’s own cells to direct the medicine where you want it to go,” he said.The UNMC project directs the medicine to the monocyte-macrophage, cells which carry the drug particle to sites of the body specifically where HIV grows.“You’re using the cell that is the target for the virus to deliver the drug against the virus,” Dr. Gendelman said.Dr. Gendelman calls the progress made “a Nebraska invention,” as it involved so many of the state’s scientists in different disciplines working together.He said this marks the third article his team has had published in major biomedical journals in recent months with all the articles related to the nanomedicine injectable therapy.The advance to use the new nanomedicines to specifically target reservoirs for viral infection was explained by Georgette Kanmogne , Ph.D., associate professor in PEN, lead investigator, and published in the International Journal of Nanomedicine. This paper describes how these drug inventions can enter the brain and ameliorate nervous system disease.The third study, published in Trends in Neurosciences, is a research area led by Larisa Poluektova, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor in PEN, and the developer of the mouse models of HIV/AIDS used in study.“We work as a team and work effectively as a team with different scientists with very different disciplines involved in different aspects of the work,” Dr. Gendelman said.This research team is made up of two UNMC colleges, four departments and two universities. The drugs were developed in UNMC labs using nanoformulation approaches.The ART tests in mouse models were made possible by UNMC’s development of specially designed mice. Because mice cannot catch human HIV, UNMC has developed mice with the equivalent of a human immune system. Such a mouse model enables advanced tests on HIV and its treatment.Dr. Kanmogne said an ART injection would be an improvement for HIV patients because it would produce all the medicine needed without the complications of remembering to take pills daily, drug toxicities, buildup of viral resistance, intestinal problems, or the social stigma of pills.The work will be presented at the forthcoming meeting for the American Society for Nanomedicine, where Dr. Gendelman will serve as conference chair.The study has been recently published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.","['hiv', 'replace', 'published', 'pill', 'mice', 'daily', 'regimen', 'jab', 'work', 'gendelman', 'art', 'drug', 'team', 'unmc', 'soon']","Researchers are trying to develop an injection that will replace the daily pill regimen for HIV patients.

Fauci, M.D., Director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Bethesda, Md., made the recommendation at a JAMA media briefing at the International AIDS Conference.Among the most important interventions is combination antiretroviral therapy, which significantly improves the health and longevity of individuals infected with HIV.“Since the advent of antiretroviral therapy, the annual number of deaths due to AIDS has decreased by two-thirds in the United States. Globally, an estimated 700,000 lives were saved in 2010 alone due to the increased availability of antiretroviral therapy in low- and middle-income countries,” Dr. Fauci and Gregory K.

Also, antiretroviral therapy is highly effective in blocking mother-to-child HIV transmission.Other important interventions include medical male circumcision, which offers a highly effective and durable way to protect heterosexual men from HIV infection; and potentially, pre-exposure prophylaxis with antiretroviral medications, which have shown promise in reducing an individual''s risk of acquiring HIV infection.“Each of these treatment and prevention strategies has a strong evidence base; with further refinement and scale-up and also when used in combination, they could have an extraordinary effect on decreasing the trajectory of the HIV pandemic,” they said.They said researchers are maintaining focus on 2 key scientific challenges that remain: the development of a vaccine and a cure. They wrote that modest success in a large-scale clinical trial of an HIV vaccine, promising results in animal models, and advances in structure-based vaccine design suggest that an HIV vaccine is feasible.

Delhi health minister AK Walia and K Srinath Reddy, director of the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), among others, were present on the occasion.Menabde said there are five main hepatitis viruses, types A, B, C, D and E, of which B and C are most lethal as they can lead to liver cirrhosis and cancer. She added, “About six lakh people die every year due to the acute or chronic consequences of hepatitis B, nearly 100 times more than HIV/AIDS.”Walia said that both hepatitis B and C spread through contact with the blood of an infected person. It can be through transfusion of infected blood, sharing of contaminated needles or injection material. Hepatitis B can also be transmitted from mother to child. “To check the spread of the disease through blood transfusion, we are going to introduce Nucleic Acid Test ( NAT ) to ensure immediate and accurate screening of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV in donated blood,” Walia said. He added that Delhi is among the first few states to have introduced vaccination for hepatitis B in the universal immunization programme.

The government is mulling to file a review petition in the Orissa high court against the court's July 28, 2011 order asking it to ensure the antigen test using nucleic acid amplification test in polymer chain reaction (NAT PCR) method to identify HIV infection in all blood banks against the ongoing test method called Elisa.

Stating the reasons behind the government's reluctance, State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC) director and convenor of the committee Dr K C Behera said studies show that the accuracy of the costlier NAT PCR test is not significantly higher compared to the Elisa method. ""There were various considerations.

The government is yet to take a final decision. We will again meet the health secretary in this connection,"" Dr Behera said. Despite attempts, health secretary P K Mahapatra could not be contacted for comment.

Sources said the committee in the health department during a recent meeting considered the findings of a Canadian study, which reportedly found that the NAT PCR method would help detect HIV in just one among one million blood units, which may be have been missed in Elisa test. Some members said the result was too insignificant.

A doctor preferring anonymity said the Canadian study may not be relevant for Indian states. Awareness level among blood donors is very high in Canada where majority of blood donors are regulars, eliminating chances of window period due to periodic tests on them before each donation.

Indian studies found detection rates of NAT PCR significantly higher compared to Elisa. A multi-centric Indian study undertaken in various centres including Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research Chandigarh, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences Lucknow and Indraprastha Apollo Hospital New Delhi, published in Indian Journal of Medical Research in 2008, has found that NAT PCR can detect one in 1,500 units of blood, which otherwise remains undetected in Elisa method.

The government's latest U-turn not to adopt NAT PCR comes around six months after another high-level committee on February 25 decided to adopt the test. The 15-member committee under the chairmanship of National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) mission director Pramod Meherda had unanimously recommended the NAT PCR technology for screening of blood to reduce the 'grey zone' period of HIV, hepatitis B and C. The committee had suggested to roll out the test in a phased manner. It had recommend forming of another seven-member committee to decide on the modalities of the test like whether to invite expression of interest and funding pattern. However, the second committee favoured not to go for the test at all.

The test, if introduced in six nodal blood banks across the state, would cover around Rs 11 crore to test over 1.81 lakh units of blood in a year. Sources said the automated NAT PCR machine is available at a cost of around Rs 3 crore.

Blood banks, however, favour introduction of NAT PCR. ""It is definitely a better method that significantly reduces the window period of HIV. We would like to introduce the test in all our blood banks if the government gives financial support,"" said Indian Red Cross state branch honorary secretary Mangala Mohanty. Of the 81 blood banks in Odisha, 56 are being run by the Red Cross.

The HC bench of Chief Justice V Gopala Gowda and Justice B N Mahapatra had passed the order for a mandatory PCR test while adjudicating on the petition of a resident of Badamba in Cuttack district. The petitioner's son was transfused blood collected from a Red Cross blood bank in Municipal Hospital in Bhubaneswar before a surgery at Neelachal Hospital when he was 10 months old. He had tested positive for HIV at the age of 17 months.","['hiv', 'blood', 'pcr', 'indian', 'banks', 'test', 'method', 'health', 'nat', 'undecided', 'committee']","BHUBANESWAR: A high-level government committee is against introduction of a more accurate test to detect HIV in blood banks.

Andhra Pradesh, which accounts for 5 lakh of the 24 lakh HIV positive in the country, remains the state with the most number of HIV-infected people, official statistics show.Government and private initiatives have helped reduce the number of people infected each year in the state, said officials of Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TNSACS). “Around 27,000 people tested positive for HIV in the state in 2009,” said a TNSACS official. “In 2010, the number dropped to 23,000, and in 2011, it fell further to 20,000. That’s a decrease of 7,000 new cases in two years.”Activists attribute the success of the state’s AIDS programme to the commitment of the health sector and the government. “Tamil Nadu was the first state to start an autonomous AIDS control society and the model, backed by political will, has been very successful,” said Dr R Lakshmibai of Tamil Nadu Aids Initiative. “National AIDS Control Organisation has recommended the model to other states.”The state has benefitted from specialized target intervention programmes that go beyond focusing on vulnerable groups such as sex workers, said M Ramar of Centre for Social Development and Social Work Research in Coimbatore who runs intervention programs for migrant workers.“Once we started targeting their clients, which spans various groups like migrant workers, truckers and youngsters, things started looking better,” Ramar said. “I see a sense of awareness among migrant workers here. Fewer migrant workers than before are testing positive each year. Red ribbon clubs are also doing good work at college level.”According to Dr Lakshmibai, intervention programmes prevented the disease from reaching generalised epidemic proportions. “There are three levels — nascent epidemic, concentrated epidemic and generalised epidemic,” she said. “The state never let it reach the generalised stage. When it looked like our intervention programs were only creating awareness and not changing behaviour, the state brought in specialised programmes.”Andhra Pradesh, on the other hand, shut down 266 of its first-level detection and counselling centres due to a cash crunch. However, Dr Lakshmibai added that although Tamil Nadu is doing well, sustaining the effort to reduce the incidence of new cases will be a challenge. “Trends and sexual behaviour keeps changing,” she said. “Agencies have to keep track of all developments while designing preventive programmes.”The state also has its work cut out in its intervention programme for transgenders. “The first survey was done only recently and shows that 9% of transgenders in the state are HIV-positive, a higher ratio than the 6% of female sex workers,” Dr Lakshmibai said.","['hiv', 'nadu', 'fewer', 'aids', 'tn', 'migrant', 'numbers', '5th', 'number', 'workers', 'lakshmibai', 'intervention', 'lakh', 'state', 'cases', 'tamil']","“Tamil Nadu was the first state to start an autonomous AIDS control society and the model, backed by political will, has been very successful,” said Dr R Lakshmibai of Tamil Nadu Aids Initiative.

The condition of children living with HIV (CLHIV) is still worse with not many paediatricians versed with care required for these children.

These were amongst the few grievances expressed by HIV positive people during the three-day grassroots level advocacy workshop organized by NGO World Vision India. Forty PLHIVs and many other NGOs participated. NGOs working in the field of HIV/AIDS like Sanjeevan, District Level PLHA Network, Eficor, Saathii, CRTDP, IID, Women Resource Center, Sharansthan, National Council of Churches in India also participated.

""The workshop aimed to strengthen the advocacy capacity of communities to address the issues faced by women and children living with HIV in different areas of the district. We wanted the PLHIVs to get the attention they deserve from the policymakers, the media, and society,"" said Joe George, programme officer of World Vision Nagpur.

The participants discussed several practical difficulties faced by them every day. ""There are no facilities for AIDS patients at village level. With the government deciding to link us with the NRHM workers, this may change. For children suffering from the disease, it would make a huge difference if government provided them nutrition,"" said Anil Dalve, president of Network for PLHIV in Maharashtra.

""The number of ART centres in the state is insufficient if we consider the fact that Maharashtra has 14% of the Indians with the disease. All these people will soon require second line treatment too. I hope the government plans to open more centres,"" said Dalve.

Daisy David, a PLHIV who now works as an advocacy associate, believes the government has good structure but what they lack is implementation and monitoring. ""When the district programme officers for AIDS speak to the NGOs working at the grassroots, they discuss projects and funds but rarely issues. They can't travel to all the villages under their jurisdiction and are unaware of the shortcomings in medical services in many of them,"" she said. If these authorities could guide and help the PLHIVs, things could improve a lot, she said.

""The vaccine showed encouraging results during animal trial stages. The toxicology has been done. I am hopeful, the clinical trial will begin by next year,"" Dr Katoch said. He was in city to attend a meeting of the ICMR tribal health research forum at Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC) in the city.

A research team at the National HIV Reference Centre in AIIMS has developed the HIV-1 DNA vaccine. During animal trials in 1996, the vaccine gave immunity to mice and monkeys from HIV sub-type C, which constitute over 95 per cent of HIV infections in India. The vaccine research had faced problems in 2002 as activists staged protest against use of animals in the tests following which trials on monkeys were then shifted to IISc Bangalore.

The research had come to a stop after retirement of the developer of the vaccine, Dr Pradeep Seth, from AIIMS earlier this year. Dr Seth had headed the microbiology department of the premier institute. ""ICMR has revived the efforts and all clearance will be hopefully in place by this year,"" he said.

Dr Katoch said attempts were made in the country earlier also to develop HIV vaccines. However, two earlier vaccines for HIV were found to have limitations. The one developed by Dr Pradeep Seth in AIIMS is being regarded very promising and may bring paradigm shift in the HIV prevention strategy in future, Dr Katoch said.

He said vaccine making is not a priority of ICMR, which is being looked after by the department of biotechnology. However, ICMR is trying its best to facilitate development of certain vaccines such as the one for HIV, which has big relevance for India, he said.","['likely', 'hiv', 'research', 'vaccine', 'human', 'icmr', 'seth', 'vaccines', 'trial', 'trials', 'dr', 'aiims', 'katoch']","BHUBANESWAR: The human trial of an HIV vaccine, which is being developed by AIIMS, New Delhi, is likely to start as early as 2013, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) director general Dr V M Katoch said here on Thursday.

359,8-9-2012,['Payal Gwalani'],https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg,"NAGPUR: Some of the Western countries are seeing the trend of 'graying' of the HIV infection, with many of the sufferers of the disease surviving upto a ripe age. Ironically, India still seems to be grappling with problems of what some call 'an invisible population group' - Children Living with HIV (CLHIV).

With insufficient government facilities for them, these children have become the first casualties of the drying up of funds being forwarded towards HIV affected people, nationally and internationally. Along with the social and psychological trauma that these kids have to go through, the physical troubles they suffer also multiply in the absence of medical services for them. Most of the NGOs who were working for this deprived lot have either phased out or are in the process of phasing out their projects. Last year, National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) withdrew financial support from many social outfits associated with the cause.

""A very few doctors understand the need of HIV-infected children. and so provide care to them.

Despite being innocent recipients of the virus for no fault of their own, these children are forced to live a life full of despair and denial,"" said Samir Shinde, who has been working since the last few years to improve the condition of CLHIV. He also says that the facilities for screening and check-up of these children are insufficient. ""There is no focused government or NGO programme for the kids. Even the Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) medicine dosages are too strong for most children, which is a reason for other health problems,"" he added.

Madhuri Giri, project coordinator for Sanjeevan, another NGO working for the positive people, said that efforts made by activists end up wasted because of changing government authorities. ""We have discussed the issues with many officials but they get transferred before they can act on the suggestions. In terms of government schemes, these children come under ICDS, where too there is no special mention of their special health and nutritional needs,"" she said. Pointing out that organizations will only help the kids till they have the project or the money, Giri underlined the need for a government project towards this end.

Lack of medical facilities for the children is amongst is another big hurdle, believes social worker Manohar Roy from Eastern Studies Society. ""There is no paediatrician trained to deal with the other infections that afflict these kids because of their weaker immunity. As opposed to this, the facilities for the elders are a little better and improving. This is simply because a Person Living with HIV (PLHIV) is a part of the vote bank, children are not,"" he said. If the dos and don'ts are explained to these kids properly, it is possible for them to be a part of the society, he said while explaining the need for emotional, psychological and medical counselling for the kids.

Director of India Peace Centre John Chelladurai agrees and adds, ""To an extent, some facilities are still there in urban and district centres but not in smaller towns and villages. We can't keep blaming the government as society also needs to be more proactive."" Education may have become the right of every child, but not many schools readily accept children having AIDS, said Harshan KY of Eficor. ""Most of these children become orphans early with nobody to take care of them. From the government's side, all they get is ART treatment, but no nutritional support that can help them have stronger immunity,"" he said.

Support Suggestions

Focused programme aimed to improve the condition of Children Living with HIV (CLHIV)

At least one doctor of each discipline in every city should be trained to handle these children

Private schools can also take up at least one positive child each

Dosage of medicines be made suitable for children

Providing facilities like institutional care, palliative care and immunization for the children

Nutritional support, in the form of health supplements like vitamins, along with ART provided by government

Making care takers aware of the special immunization schedules for CLHIVs

Counseling of High Risk Groups to limit the number of children who are born with the infection

City NGOs' 24x7 care centre for +ve kids

Looking at the dismal way of life Children Living with HIV (CLHIV) are forced to live in the country, some city NGO's decided to change the scenario. Having completed three years of running a day care centre Tehillim Ministries of Charity (TMC), Maharashtra Positive Women's Network and National Integration Society, they are now aiming at establishing a centre of excellence for CLHIVs.

They will now be extending the care provided in their centre to be available 24x7. The ever increasing number of children with the disease, most of whom have lost their parents, they say are denied treatment in government establishments and can't afford that provided by private institutions. The centre will also be providing the children counseling and treatment facilities.

""With constant care being very necessary for these kids, we thought of supporting them in every possible way. Also, if the government can not provide something, instead of complaining, we thought of taking up their cause,"" said Jefferey Nelson, president of TMC, while explaining the idea behind the centre of excellence.

Most CHLIVs are either orphan or semi-orphan, so they do not get the constant care they need, said Varsha Gaikwad, president Positive Women's Network. ""They need regular follow-ups for which not many doctors are available. Also, preventive care is more important for them in the absence of which they know the existence of diseases only when it is in the last stage,"" she said. Since the volunteers of these organizations have known most of the kids through the years and know their medical history, they are better equipped to help them, she believes.

President of National Integration Society Achchelal Chauhan believes that the project acquires more importance since the government facilities available earlier do not exist any longer. ""The government provided facilities like Community Care Centre (CCCs) earlier. But that too was shut down a year ago. The children are being provided with medicines by the government, but not the necessary information and emotional support,"" he said.

The state government has also decided to give preference in jobs to people with AIDS, while process is also on to provide pension to them. People with AIDS would also be carried free to and fro the ART centres. All these measures were announced on Thursday when a specially designed train, Red Ribbon Express, entered Bihar via Kishanganj district.

Red Ribbon Express has special audio-visual systems to create awareness about causes of HIV/AIDS. It also has a condom vending machine, a Bihar State Aids Control Society (BSACS) official said. It was flagged off from New Delhi on January 12 this year.

Choubey said there was an urgent need to involve more and more people in creating awareness about AIDS at every level as there is a misconception that it is a contagious disease. It occurs due to unsafe sex, contaminated blood transfusion and from mother to child during pregnancy or breastfeeding, Choubey said, adding involving rural people, particularly youth, in this programme would help create awareness about it. Awareness would also be created at different fairs of the state, including the Sonepur fair, the minister said.

There are around 12,000 people with AIDS in Bihar, while another 50,000 are HIV +. The largest number of HIV+ people are in Patna district. Migration of people from other districts to Patna for treatment has increased the number of HIV positive people in the district, a health department official said.

These antibodies are capable of stopping the HIV virus from entering blood cells and replicating , thereby arresting an HIV-infected person's progression to AIDS. (An antibody is an infection-fighting protein produced by our immune system when it detects harmful substances like viruses and bacteria.)Called Protocol G, the global project to identify bNabs was started in 2006 by the International Aids Vaccine Initiative (IAVI). So far, blood samples of 1,800 such HIV patients have been screened across 12 countries and 19 bNAbs identified. Margaret McGlynn , IAVI president told TOI that these special antibodies hold vital clues to the design of an effective AIDS vaccine that has eluded scientists so far.The Chennai-based Solomon is busy identifying a rare tribe of HIV-infected patients from across India who've been healthy for years without requiring life-saving anti-retroviral treatment (ART). These people are called ""elite controllers"" . ""The goal is to isolate antibodies that are broadly effective against Clade C subtype of HIV, which predominates in India,"" McGlynn added.The blood samples collected are sent to the all-new Translational Health Sciences and Technology Institute (THSTI) in Gurgaon where scientists will isolate antibodies for testing and see if any of them can stop a variety of HIV subtypes from infecting their target cells.Solomon, who works at YR Gaitonde Center for AIDS Research and Education (YRG CARE) said, ""Only a minority of people who are infected with HIV produce bNAbs. Although HIV is a wildly mutable virus, certain parts of it are relatively resistant to change. These are essential to the virus's ability to infect, and they are the elements of HIV that bNAbs target.""Till now, blood samples from 39 elite controllers have been collected. ""We look for patients who've been infected for over four years but have not required ART. We estimate that of 100 such people, 20% would contain a bNab. We are collecting their blood samples and isolating cells that produce the bNab.""Solomon's team aims to collect samples from 200 elite controllers. ""If IAVI manages to isolate a bNab from any of these blood samples, we will call the patient back and collect 200 ml of blood from him or her over a period of six months. We will then prepare more bNabs from it and try to develop a vaccine,"" she says.IAVI India chief Rajat Goyal says these antibodies could ultimately reveal the Achilles' heel of the virus and help create the HIV vaccine . Experts at the THSTI will look at how the bNab binds to the virus. This will tell scientists which part of the virus the vaccine should target. ""The idea is to create artificially synthesized mimics of their targets on HIV, to be used in vaccines to elicit similar actions and teach the immune system how to thwart HIV infection,"" experts said.""With 7,100 people contracting HIV every day, effective tools to prevent infection are indispensable in the fight against HIV. A broadlyeffective AIDS vaccine would be a powerful asset,"" said M K Bhan, secretary of the department of biotechnology.No bNabs have yet been isolated in the India programme . But it's early days yet, said McGlynn. ""Serum samples collected will first be analyzed for their breadth of neutralization of HIV - in other words, the variety of HIV strains they can neutralize in laboratory assays. The most broadly neutralizing sera will be further analyzed to isolate and clone the antibodies responsible for that activity.""Those antibodies will then be studied in detail for their biochemistry and, if possible, molecular structures and the structures that each targets on the HIV virus .

NAT PCR is regarded as the most accurate test to identify HIV infection, far more dependable than the Elisa and rapid test kit methods in which HIV may remain undetected for a prolonged window period.

Making the announcement during an adjournment motion discussion in the Odisha assembly, health minister Damodar Rout said the test was quite costly and the government had decided to introduce the test at the three government-run medical colleges and the Capital Hospital in the first phase. It will be introduced at other places in a phased manner, he added.

Admitting that two specific cases of HIV transmission through contaminated blood had come to the government's notice, the minister said, ""The government will take all required steps to ensure people have access to safe blood.""

Rout explained that the window period of HIV non-detection is 89 days in rapid test kits, and 21 days in Elisa method. In case of NAT PCR, the window period is only seven days. The minister further said the government had decided to abolish the rapid test method completely as it had the highest margin of error.

The National AIDS Control Organization and National Blood Transfusion Council have no directives to conduct NAT PCR tests, but countrywide, around 20 blood banks use the method, he informed the house.

Raising the motion earlier, Congress chief whip Prasad Harichandan wanted to know what steps the government had taken in view of the ""increase in instances of infected blood being given by blood banks."" Citing a study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the law maker said the prevalent methods were unsafe.

The ICMR study, undertaken in various centres including the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, and Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, New Delhi, was published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research in 2008. It shows that the NAT PCR method can detect one HIV positive case in every 1,500 blood samples tested negative in the Elisa method.

The test, if introduced in six nodal blood banks across the state, would cost around Rs 11 crore to test over 1.81 lakh units of blood in a year. An automated NAT PCR machine costs around Rs 3 crore.

The Orissa high court, in July 28, 2011, had asked the state government to ensure that the NAT PCR method is used identify HIV infection.

A bench of Chief Justice V Gopala Gowda and Justice B N Mahapatra had passed the order while hearing the petition of a resident of Badamba in Cuttack district. The petitioner's son was transfused blood collected from Red Cross Blood Bank in Municipal Hospital in Bhubaneswar before a surgery at Neelachal Hospital when he was 10-month old. He tested positive for HIV at the age of 17 months.","['hospital', 'hiv', 'medical', 'blood', 'pcr', 'window', 'test', 'detect', 'nucleic', 'introduce', 'method', 'nat', 'govt', 'state', 'acid', 'infection']","BHUBANESWAR: After much dithering, the state government on Saturday said it would soon introduce the nucleic acid amplification test in polymer chain reaction (NAT PCR) method for screening blood before transfusion.

She added that the department had already sought opinions from NGOs working for the welfare of HIV patients and the UNICEF among others in this context.

Department officials said that the minister also had plans to convene a meeting of stakeholders in the next few days to discuss the pros and the cons of the move.

The move will require amendment to provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and other allied Acts.

The move is aimed at saving the predicament of individuals who become AIDS victims because of their partners. A pre-marriage test would act as a preventive measure, the official said.

The bone of contention that is up for debate is whether making these tests mandatory would ostracize the infected person in his/her community.

The order comes after the guardians of the boy, who was three days old at the time of the operation, filed a complaint against Kalawati Saran Children’s hospital (KSCH), and the HOD of paediatric surgery at Lady Hardinge Medical College & KSCH, Dr Ajay Kumar.



Noting that the minor contracted a serious disease due to which he cannot survive long, the Commission has awarded Rs 10 lakh as compensation for “mental agony,” “harassment,” and litigation charges. The boy’s parents had asked for a compensation of Rs 22 lakh along with Rs 30,000 as litigation expenses.



The Commission referred the matter to the medical board of Maulana Azad Medical College, which said, “It was incumbent on the part of the doctor who transfused the blood to a patient, screening for HIV should have been done.” There was nothing on record to show how the doctor came to the conclusion that the blood was not contaminated, said the order.



The Commission was also shocked at the doctor’s defence that the blood was tested at the blood bank and had no HIV infection. “It is very strange that Dr Ajay Kumar has not filed any affidavit to show that such a test was conducted by the blood bank,” stated the order.



Taking note of the evidence on record, the order said, the patient had an ailment called FUC-Diaphragmatic for which he was operated on June 12, 1998. It is on account of medical negligence that the minor has HIV.



“The transfusion of the blood to the patient is not in dispute. Obviously, there is sheer medical negligence on the part of opposing parties in not examining the blood and ensuring that it does not contain any HIV infection,” stated the order passed by Commission members VK Gupta and Salma Noor.The Commission also took into account that the child could not have inherited the ailment from his parents since there were “ample documents” to show that the parents did not have HIV infection in their blood.In the complaint the guardians stated that on June 12, 1998, a three-day-old baby was admitted to the children’s hospital for a FUC-Diaphragmatic surgery . The parents were asked to release 1.5 ml of blood for the surgery. After the surgery , the child was discharged . However, the minor was again admitted to the hospital in August 1998 with the same problem along with a Mal rotation Adhesive Intestinal Obstruction due to which the child was not accepting feed.

ALLAHABAD: Following Allahabad being termed by National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) biggest host of HIV/Aids-infected persons in Uttar Pradesh, officials of the UP State Aids Control Society (UPSACS) are working at a breakneck pace to collect block level data (BLD) to ascertain the exact figure of HIV/AIDS patients.

The NACO has placed five UP districts, including Allahabad, Azamgarh, Deoria, Etawah and Banda under its scanner after these districts were placed under sensitive category in migration of HIV/AIDS infected persons.

Allahabad being termed most sensitive, greater stress is being laid on collecting actual data of victims from all 20 blocks of the district and offering treatment and counseling to patients.

UPSACS officials of are carrying out an intensive drive to check the health status of migrants and identify their locations with an aim to offer them counseling and treatment as well as assistance. They are also conducting studies regarding the migration pattern and prevalence of HIV..

Nodal officer, District Aids Programme Control Unit ( DAPCU), Dr O P Shahi told TOI that migrant labourers, truckers and MSM (men having sex with men) were being identified in the district as they were most responsible for and vulnerable to spread of the deadly disease. He added that efforts were underway to identify them so that they could be offered best possible treatment and counselling. During surveys, it has come to notice that victims due to various reasons including social stigma, do not come forward and reel under depression, said Dr Shahi.

Three kinds of migrants are primarily responsible for the spread of the deadly disease including workers at brick kilns, stone cutting, mining, silica mining centres and service clusters (who migrate from one state to another for employment. Dr Shahi said under the directives of NACO and UPACS, district health authorities are busy locating the infected persons with the aim of offering them treatment, assistance and counseling.

UPSACS officials have also been spreading awareness under the information, education and communication (IEC) programme.

Last year, a NACO monitoring committee visited the city to find reasons behind the rapid increase in transmission of HIV in the district. The team had also inspected services being offered to HIV+ and AIDS patients at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC).

The NACO initiative comes in the wake of Allahabad being placed under the high risk group as far as spread of HIV is concerned.

Dr Shahi informed that the villages prone to high risk have been put under the scanner and a series of awareness and educational camps are being launched to check the menace.

Pointedly, NACO has also asked UPSACS to check the status of migrants living in these villages as they are among prime carriers of HIV in the district.

As far as route of infection and risk transmission categories are concerned, in about 85.3 per cent cases the disease spreads due to unsafe sexual contact, while 3.80 per cent, 2.05 per cent, 3.34 per cent and 6.46 per cent cases are due to prenatal transmission, blood transfusion, injectable drug users and others, respectively.

Currently, three NGOs are implementing the targeted interventions among the high risk groups in the district covering commercial female sex workers (FSWs), men having sex with men (MSM) and Intravenous drug users.","['hiv', 'aids', 'momentum', 'census', 'naco', 'sex', 'migrants', 'spread', 'risk', 'cent', 'men', 'jarkhand', 'district', 'treatment', 'gains']","He added that efforts were underway to identify them so that they could be offered best possible treatment and counselling.

Lead scientist from University of Melbourne Marit Kramski found that when pregnant cows were vaccinated with an HIV protein, the first milk produced by the cow after giving birth, called colostrum, produced high antibodies to protect its newborn against disease.



Researchers were now planning to test the effectiveness and safety of the milk before turning it into a cream which will hopefully allow women to protect themselves against contracting the virus during sex, without relying on men, the Herald Sun reported.



However, the final result could be a decade off. The researchers were able to inhibit the virus from infecting cells when combing the virus cells with milk.



""We think the antibodies bind to the surface of the virus and blocks the protein which needs to be freed to get in contact with human cells - like a key and lock system. If the key's not accessible or you change the key, you can't open the door,"" Kramski said adding ""It's a very cheap and easy way to produce a lot of antibodies.""



Kramski had partnered with Australian biotechnology company Immuron Ltd to develop the milk, and would continue working with them to produce a preventative cream.""We have the antibodies at the moment - the next step will be formulation,"" Kramski said.Condoms were ""cheap and easy"" but not an option for everyone with millions of people getting infected with HIV every year, she added.""A lot of women, especially in Africa or South America they don't have the power to say you need to use a condom before we have sex.""This milk looks like it can be a cheap, easy new prevention tool, because if you use drugs it's really expensive,"" she said.","['hiv', 'cows', 'study', 'kramski', 'protects', 'virus', 'women', 'easy', 'cells', 'protect', 'antibodies', 'cheap', 'milk']","MELBOURNE: Cow's milk can be potentially developed into affordable creams that can help protect humans against HIV, a study has claimed.

Imagine the smell of delicacies and hit numbers from Bollywood flicks filling the air when you're surviving on IV drops. And imagine screams of ""aschhe bochhor abar hobe"" from the immersion procession making you think whether you can endure the pain for another year.

What makes you shudder even in your imagination is the life of a group of patients undergoing treatment at the School of Tropical Medicine, which primarily treats HIV cases. Most of them don't hope to do what everyone does on Puja days any more as they're fighting a losing battle against the killer disease.

""So what they cannot step out, we can always step in,"" thought D Ashis, general secretary of Medical Bank. Thus began a unique initiative in which the organization started carrying the spirit of Durga Puja on the hospital campus. On the occasion of Panchami on Friday, doctors, attendants and members of the group shared some light moments with the patients to lessen their burden of pain. Sarees, dhotis and sweets were also distributed to bring a feeling of newness to their otherwise agonizing lives.

""With so many people caring for us, I feel like living again. Otherwise, the way we - the HIV patients - have been stigmatized makes me feel like a burden on the society,"" said Asmina Begumwith pain creased all over her face.

Parmeet Singh, another HIV patient in the male ward, echoed: ""I've been destined to go through the pain, so there's no point complaining. But it really hurts when I think of how I spent the last Puja and what's in store this time. I've learnt that life doesn't give a second chance,"" he regretted.

For Anima, however, it's a relief to be in the hospital. Since she was diagnosed with HIV virus, not a single day passed when her in-laws didn't abuse her. ""For me, spending a single fun-filled day in the hospital is better than four traumatic days at home during Durga Puja,"" she sighed.

""We need to treat the fear before we cure the disease. Life for these people wouldn't have been so miserable had the society been a little sympatheticto them. I feel such an initiative will act as an eye-opener for those whose feel HIV patients should be shunted out of our lives,"" said PK Guha, the hospital superintendent.

Project director, Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RSACS), Dr JP Dhamija said: ""It would not be a forceful testing of HIV. We will only provide the facilities for HIV testing.

Researchers from the Imperial College London claim that their visual sensor technology is ten times more sensitive than the current gold standard methods for measuring biomarkers.

These indicate the onset of diseases such as prostate cancer and infection by viruses including HIV. The colour of a liquid changes to give either a positive or negative result. Researchers say their sensor would benefit countries where sophisticated detection equipment is scarce, enabling cheaper and simpler detection and treatments for patients.

The team tested the effectiveness of the sensor by detecting a biomarker called p24 in blood samples, which indicates HIV infection. ""Unfortunately, the existing gold standard detection methods can be too expensive to be implemented in parts of the world where resources are scarce,"" Professor Molly Stevens, from the Departments of Materials and Bioengineering, said.

""Our approach affords for improved sensitivity, does not require sophisticated instrumentation and it is ten times cheaper, which could allow more tests to be performed for better screening of many diseases,"" said Stevens.

Researchers also tested samples for the biomarker called Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), which is an early indicator for Prostate Cancer.

Pradip, who is undergoing Anti-Retroviral Therapy (Art), is competing at the eighth Senior Mr Asia championship in Ludhiana in the first week of November. The next month, he will take part in the 4th Mr World Championship in Bangkok.

A resident of Khamnam Leirak in Imphal West, Pradip (43) disclosed his health status to the media a few days after bagging the 60-kg category senior 'Mr Manipur' title in a state-level competition held here in December, 2007. Pradip, a brand ambassador of Manipur Aids Control Society (Macs), later bagged silver and bronze medals in different national competitions and stood eighth in the 'Mr World' competition.

Manipur is one of the six high HIV/AIDS prevalence states of the country. According to Macs, the state has 38,016 people infected with HIV, including 10,109 women and 2,578 children. Pradip, who has emerged as an icon of inspiration to the world, spends around Rs 40,000 in procuring foreign nutritional diet every month.

""Macs, which used to pay Rs 8,000 a month for my nutritional support, has stopped extending the amount since June this year,"" Pradip informed TOI on Monday.

""The state government which had promised to appoint me as a regular employee in the youth affairs and sports department in 2009 also failed to do anything about it. This was another major setback,"" said Pradip. A group of HIV positive widows of the state launched a charity campaign to collect money for him after they came to know about his financial condition. They are providing me monetary help and I am very thankful to them, he said.

Recently, a social organization donated Rs 1.5 lakh to the bodybuilder for his cause, he said.

I was a little scared in the beginning, but I made a lot of new friends,” she said coyly.Maya is among the 34 residents of a children’s home in Bandikavanur village, about 30km from Chennai, who stepped into a school for the first time on Wednesday after HIV played havoc in their lives. They are all children of HIV+ve people.While most of them have lost either or both of their parents, 19 of them inherited the virus. The children — 18 girls and 16 boys — were admitted to a primary school in the village in Thiruvallur district under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan’s ‘Education for all’ scheme.For most of these children, the scheme gave them their first shot at leading a “normal” life. “I’ve often stood by the gate of the children’s home and watched school kids in uniforms jostle with one another. I wished I could join them and be their friend, but I wasn’t sure if they would accept me. Today, I finally got a chance to be a student,” said 10-year-old Mani*, who lost both his parents to HIV.The 34 children, from across the state, are currently under the care of the Community Health Education Society (CHES), which has a home in the village that houses 85 HIV infected and affected children. Most of them find schooling difficult because of opposition from the school authorities and other parents who know about their health status.Bandikavanur Panchayat Union Primary school principal N Shanthi said it wasn’t easy admitting these children. “In the beginning, we had decided not to reveal the children’s background, but word soon got around and we had parents approaching us asking if their wards would get infected. Explaining the situation wasn’t easy, but the panchayat head and elders in the village got together and explained things to them,” she said. The school also made provisions to cater to the medical needs of the children and the teachers are being trained to handle emergencies.For CHES, it marks the end of a 19-year struggle. “For close to two decades, we have been trying to send HIV-affected children to mainstream schools, but few would admit them. Even if they were admitted, the children would drop out as they couldn't bear the discrimination.

In Trichy, the desire for remarriage is growing among widowers. However, very few widows who are HIV positive want to remarry.

According to statistics from the district administration, there are 11,097 people including 6,654 males and 4,443 females who are HIV positive. Most of the women are said to have received the killer syndrome from their husbands.

With a view to finding a suitable life partner for both men and women patients, two marriage information bureaus exclusively for HIV people have been functioning in Trichy for the past six years. The marriage bureaus neither encourage nor discourage marriage. They simply explain to them the merits and demerits of marriage and let the parties decide. On the other hand, the counsellors believe that such marriages might prevent HIV positive men from spreading the virus through affairs.

The two marriage bureaus have so far received about 250 applications seeking life partners. Interestingly, most of the applicants are widowers between 30 and 50. However, the number of widow applicants are nearly 50. Since there is a possibility that babies born to such couples will become HIV-affected, the marriage bureaus counsel the pairs to have safe sex to avoid having children. But the couples seemingly want to have children.

The HIV-affected men want to get married for various social and personal reasons. ""The decision to remarry involves many reasons. First, many widowers do not want to expose themselves by being alone. So, they want to marry to hide their disease. Some of them are forced by their families to get married. There are many persons who want to enter wedlock for marital consummation. Interestingly, a 50-year-old man has now applied for remarriage. Since 2008, we received 39 applications from men and five applications from women. But only 12 marriages have taken place so far and seven children have been born through such marriages. All the children tested HIV negative,"" said A Thamil, a HIV positive person who runs Network for Positive People in Trichy.

Thamil also said, ""Most women are affected by HIV because of their husbands. Many of them have begotten children through their marriage. Unfortunately, the sudden deaths of their husbands put the future of both mother and child at risk. Nevertheless, they do not want to think of remarriage because they do not want to lead a volatile life.""","['hiv', 'positive', 'trichy', 'children', 'walk', 'remarriage', 'widowers', 'hivhit', 'women', 'road', 'tough', 'bureaus', 'men', 'marriage']","However, very few widows who are HIV positive want to remarry.

HIV-related travel restrictions at present exist in 45 countries.The Global AIDS Epidemic 2012 report, released by UNAIDS on Tuesday, says that the effects of such restrictions are severe for migrant workers, who play an increasingly prominent role in the global economy.There is a blanket ban on entry of people living with HIV in five countries — Brunei Darussalam, Oman, Sudan, the UAE and Yemen.Five other countries — Egypt, Singapore, Iraq, Qatar and Turks and Caicos Islands — require individuals wishing to stay for short periods (10–90 days) to prove that they are HIV-negative.Laws in 20 countries, including Malaysia, Russia, Singapore, Jordan and Kuwait, deport individuals discovered to be living with HIV.Even in the epidemic's fourth decade globally, nearly four in 10 countries worldwide still lack any specific legal provisions to prevent or address HIV-related discrimination.The number of international migrants rose from 191 million to 214 million between 2005 and 2010.The report says that the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) – Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE – all mandatorily test people seeking to come to the Gulf countries to work and require them to be periodically tested to renew visas.""Those who become HIV-positive while working in the Gulf are often quarantined, deported, denied appropriate health care and ostracized upon returning to their home countries. Migrants' HIV-positive test results are shared with all approved by the medical centres in the Gulf Cooperation Council, with such workers categorized as ""permanently unfit"" to enter any Gulf Cooperation Council country in the future,"" the report said.India lifted all travel restrictions against HIV-positive patients in 2010.In 2002, the Union health ministry had issued a notification, stating that mandatory test for HIV for India-bound foreign nationals should be removed from visa forms. However, some embassies failed to enforce it, and continued to display the requirement of HIV test certificate on their websites as well as on visa forms.On September 17, 2010, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) clarified that there are no travel or residency restrictions for People Living with HIV (PLHIV) coming to India.UNAIDS says that most of these restrictions were imposed in the early years of the epidemic, when little was understood about HIV prevention and effective HIV treatment did not exist.""In 2012, governments increasingly recognize that these restrictions make no sense in a world in which HIV exists in every country, people living with HIV are living long and productive lives and equal freedom of movement is not only a human right but essential in a globalized world. Of note is the decline in the number of countries, territories and areas with HIV-related travel restrictions from 96 in 2000 to 45 in 2012,"" UNAIDS said.UNAIDS aims to eliminate these restrictions by 2015.Since 2010, Armenia, China, Fiji, Namibia, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of Moldova, Ukraine and the US have repealed such restrictions. Where such restrictions continue to exist, other forms of HIV stigma and discrimination are usually common.The World Health Organization (WHO) pointed out that such entry restrictions mount pressure on people into concealing their HIV infection from immigration authorities.""They simply do not carry their HIV medicines on international trips. This could lead to drug-resistant HIV strains that are transmissible to other people. Besides, drug resistance allows HIV to replicate in the body more freely, people with higher viral loads are also more infectious,"" WHO said.","['hiv', 'affecting', 'restrictions', 'patients', 'bar', 'world', 'test', 'gulf', 'hivrelated', 'countries', 'global', 'travel', 'report', 'living', 'unaids', 'economy']","NEW DELHI: Nearly 25 years after HIV was detected in India, travel restrictions continue to bar patients from free movement through nations.

Globally, 2.5 million people became newly infected with HIV in 2011.Half of all reductions in new HIV infections in the last two years have been among newborn children showing that elimination of new infections in children is possible.In 2011, there were 34 million people living with HIV. In South and south-east Asia, an estimated 4 million people were living with HIV in 2011, compared to 3.7 million in 2001.The same year, new infections in children were 43% lower than in 2003, and 24% lower than 2009. However, 72% of children living with HIV do not have any access to treatment.An estimated 6.8 million people are eligible for treatment, but don't have access.These are the findings of the Global AIDS Epidemic 2012 report released by UNAIDS on Tuesday. The number of people accessing HIV treatment has increased by 63% between 2009 and 2011.In India, however, around 60% people requiring treatment are getting it. ""The pace of progress is quickening — what used to take a decade is now being achieved in 24 months,"" said Michel Sidibé, executive director of UNAIDS. ""We are scaling up faster and smarter than ever before. It is the proof that with political will and follow through we can reach our shared goals by 2015,"" he said.Gains have been made in reducing tuberculosis (TB)-related AIDS deaths in people living with HIV. In the last 24 months, a 13% decrease in TB-related AIDS deaths was observed. This accomplishment is due to record number of people with HIV/TB co-infection accessing antiretroviral treatment, which is recorded at 45%.UNAIDS also estimates that an additional 4 million discordant couples (where one partner is living with HIV) would benefit from HIV treatment to protect their partners from HIV infection.Of the 34 million people living with HIV, about half do not know their HIV status. The report states that if more people knew their status, they could come forward for HIV services.For example, South Africa increased its scale up of HIV treatment by 75% in the last two years—ensuring 1.7 million people had access to the lifesaving treatment—and new HIV infections have fallen by more than 50,000 in only two years.The report shows that a more than 50% reduction in the rate of new HIV infections has been achieved across 25 low and middle-income countries –– more than half in Africa, the region most affected by HIV.In some of the countries which have the highest HIV prevalence in the world, rates of new HIV infections have been cut dramatically since 2001 — by 73% in Malawi, Botswana (71%), Namibia (68%), Zambia (58%), Zimbabwe (50%), South Africa and Swaziland (41%).In addition to welcome results in HIV prevention, sub-Saharan Africa has reduced AIDS-related deaths by one-third in the last six years and increased the number of people on antiretroviral treatment by 59% in the last two years alone.The area where perhaps most progress is being made is in reducing new HIV infections in children. Half of the global reductions in new HIV infections in the last two years have been among newborn children. ""It is becoming evident that achieving zero new HIV infections in children is possible,"" said Sidibé. ""I am excited that far fewer babies are being born with HIV. We are moving from despair to hope,"" he added.The report shows that antiretroviral therapy has emerged as a powerful force for saving lives. In the last 24 months the numbers of people accessing treatment has increased by 63% globally. In sub-Saharan Africa, a record 2.3 million people had access to treatment. China has increased the number of people on HIV treatment by nearly 50% in the last year alone. There were more than half a million fewer deaths in 2011 than in 2005. The largest drops in AIDS-related deaths are being seen in countries where HIV has the strongest grip. South Africa saw (100,000) fewer deaths, Zimbabwe (nearly 90,000), Kenya (71,000) and Ethiopia (48,000) than in 2005.","['records', 'hiv', 'africa', 'children', 'deaths', 'half', 'million', 'infections', '25', 'dip', 'living', 'increased', 'treatment', 'india']","Globally, 2.5 million people became newly infected with HIV in 2011.Half of all reductions in new HIV infections in the last two years have been among newborn children showing that elimination of new infections in children is possible.In 2011, there were 34 million people living with HIV.

The family was evicted from their house on November 6 after a worker of an NGO, Jeevan Aadhar Community Care Centre, made it public to their neighbours that they were HIV positive. The head of the family, a mason, with his pregnant wife and four children where manhandled and thrown out of their house by neighbours. The entire family then shifted to Umaid Hospital as the woman suffered injuries and started bleeding when the neighbours pushed them out of the locality. The neighbours claimed that they would also get infected if the family continued to live there.

Once out of the hospital, the family spent time wandering here and there in the city and finally made railway station their home where they were spotted by a local NGO, Jodhpur Network of People Living with AIDS. ""We initiated the efforts to rehabilitate them and brought the matter to the notice of the administration,"" said Dinesh Joshi of the NGO.

Earlier, an average of 30-40 per cent of the children born to HIV positive women used to be HIV positive. However, this has reduced to 3 - 4 per cent after PCTP was introduced. Under PCTP, Nevirapine, anti-retroviral (ART) tablets, are given to pregnant women living with HIV. Nevirapine syrup is given to new born babies,"" Dr Kishore said.The Union government has introduced another PCTP to check the transmission of HIV recently, wherein anti-retroviral medicines are administered to HIV positive women from their fourth month of pregnancy, Kishore said adding that the programme is aimed at bringing the parent to children transmission rate to zero in the district. The number of HIV positive pregnant women too has reduced considerably in the district in the past five years. While 79 out of 14,764 pregnant women tested positive in 2007, the number has decreased to 20 out of 19,515 in 2012.","['hiv', 'decline', 'positive', 'percentage', 'pregnant', 'number', 'women', 'transmission', 'kishore', 'pctp', 'district', 'cases']","MANGALORE: The number of HIV positive cases is on the decline in Dakshina Kannada district for the past five years.While the district recorded 1,225 positive cases in 2007, the number has come down to 916 in 2011 and 778 in 2012.The district has one more reason to cheer.
The percentage of HIV positive cases in the district is much lesser than that in Karnataka.
Earlier, an average of 30-40 per cent of the children born to HIV positive women used to be HIV positive.
Under PCTP, Nevirapine, anti-retroviral (ART) tablets, are given to pregnant women living with HIV.

407,20-12-2012,['Kounteya Sinha'],https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg,"NEW DELHI: India recorded around 60,000 fewer deaths due to HIV in 2011 compared to 2007 while the overall number of people living with HIV has fallen by almost 1.7 lakhs during the same period.There has been a 57% reduction in new HIV infections in India during the last decade with HIV prevalence among adults (15-49 years) dipping to 0.27% (2011) compared to 0.33% (2007).The total number of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) in India is estimated at 21 lakhs last year. Children (below 15 years) account for 7% of all infections, and 86% are in the 15-49 age bracket.Worryingly, of all the HIV infections, 39% (8.16 lakhs) are among women , most of whom being housewives.The new HIV estimated released by Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad on Friday – on the eve of the World AIDS Day — says that around 1.16 lakh new HIV infections among adults and around 14,500 new infections among children had occurred last year.Of the 1.16 lakh estimated new infections in 2011 among adults, the six high-prevalence states of Andhra Pradesh Tamil Nadu , Karnataka, Maharashtra, Manipur and Nagaland accounted for 31% of new infections.Considerable declines in HIV prevalence have been recorded among female sex workers at national level (5.06% in 2007 to 2.67% in 2011) and in most of the states, where long-standing targeted interventions have focused on behaviour change and increase in condom use. Declines have been achieved among men who have sex with men (7.41% in 2007 to 4.43% in 2011) also, though several pockets in the country show higher HIV prevalence among them with mixed results.Reduction in HIV cases among Injecting Drug Users (IDUs) at the national level haven’t been significant (7.23% in 2007 to 7.14% in 2011).Besides north-eastern states where declines have been achieved, newer pockets of high HIV prevalence among IDUs have emerged over the last few years, mainly in states like Punjab, Chandigarh, Delhi, Mumbai, Kerala, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh , Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.The report says that scale up of free anti retroviral treatment (ART) since 2004 has saved over 1.5 lakh lives till last year.At the current pace of scale up of ART services, it is estimated to avert around 50,000–60,000 deaths annually in the next five years.Azad told TOI, “India’s progress in controlling the deadly virus has been remarkable. China, India and South Africa are the only three countries which have witnessed a fall in new HIV cases by over 50%. The recent UN general assembly on HIV unanimously hailed these countries for such progress.”In 2011, among the states, Manipur has shown the highest estimated adult HIV prevalence of 1.22%, followed by Andhra Pradesh (0.75%), Mizoram (0.74%), Nagaland (0.73%), Karnataka (0.52%), Goa (0.43%) and Maharashtra (0.42%).Besides these, Odisha, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, and Chandigarh have shown estimated adult HIV prevalence greater than the national prevalence at 0.27%.The study said, “The adult HIV prevalence at national level has continued its steady decline from estimated level of 0.41% in 2001 through 0.35% in 2006 to 0.27% in 2011. Similar consistent declines are noted among both males and females at national level.”About 1.48 lakh people died of AIDS-related causes in India last year. Deaths among HIV infected children account for 7% of all AIDS-related deaths. Wider access to ART has led to 29% reduction in estimated annual AIDS-related deaths during NACP-III period (2007-2011).Thanks to fall in India’s HIV numbers, south-east Asia (11 countries, including India) has seen a 35% dip in new HIV infections, from 3.2 lakhs (2001) to 2.08 lakhs (2011). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the HIV epidemic is clearly reversing. In 2011, 2.2 million people across the world were infected with HIV and 1.7 million died, half a million fewer new infections than 10 years ago, and 6 lakhs fewer deaths than 2005. However, the global health watch dog said the region also faces serious challenges. In the region, 46% of adults in need of treatment were enrolled in care and treatment by the end of 2011 – up from 12% in 2005. The coverage for HIV treatment in children is 39% in 2011 – up from 9% in 2005. Starting treatment early reduces morbidity and mortality due to HIV, and recent studies have also confirmed the prevention benefits of early treatment in uninfected regular sexual partners of HIV-infected individuals.“The overall decline in the region is cause for increased optimism, however complacency now could become our greatest enemy,” said Dr Samlee Plianbangchang, regional director of WHO south-east Asia.“Those most vulnerable to HIV are also among the least empowered and HIV prevention care and treatment services for these people need to be made available and accessible,” he added.","['60000', 'hiv', '2011', 'lives', 'estimated', 'deaths', 'states', 'prevalence', 'infections', 'lakhs', 'treatment', 'india', 'claimed']","China, India and South Africa are the only three countries which have witnessed a fall in new HIV cases by over 50%.

The state's apex body for control of HIV/AIDS in Goa, incidentally, doesn't receive data of blood tests done at private laboratories, so the numbers-including the overall for the state-could be higher, said officials.The only other taluka to see a rise in HIV numbers this year is Ponda-two up from 26 recorded last year. Most of the other 11 talukas have seen declines.Commenting on Canacona's rise in numbers, GSACS project director Dr Rajananda Desai said the tourist-centric beaches in the taluka-Palolem and Galgibaga-could have contributed to the overall numbers. The coastal belts of the state have always been considered very vulnerable to the virus.Remarkable declines in numbers were recorded in Salcete (52; down 34 from last year's 86), Mormugao (77; down 37 from last year's 114), Tiswadi (33; down 26 from 59), Quepem (10; down nine from 19) and Pernem (4; down seven from 11).

Agencies working for HIV prevention in the state attributed the high prevalence to migration.Project director of Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) Ramesh Devkar said: “While more people are approaching care centres, migration is one of the main causes why we continue to remain a hotbed.”The state has come off as the worst for HIV among female sex workers (FSW) with prevalence at 6.89% against a national average of 2.67%.

But while most AIDS patients see death staring at them, this gutsy 40-year-old woman and her 15-year-old son have refused to let the demon run havoc in their life.Aruna Sarkar's husband Sujoy committed suicide in 1999, unable to come to terms with the fact that he was HIV positive. By then he had already passed on the virus to Aruna and the couple's only son Debaditya. On World AIDS day the mother-son duo prays that no one in this world gets infected for no fault of theirs.Everything looked rosy for Aruna and Sujoy when they tied the knot in 1996. A few months later Sujoy left for Mumbai to work as radio officer with an oil major. He would come back to stay with his family in their Salt Lake house during leaves. It was during such trips home that his family noticed him falling ill often. Though Sujoy had got his HIV status detected in Mumbai, he did not dare share it with any of his family members, not even his wife.""My husband probably could not accept that fact that he had the virus. In addition the guilt that he might have infected me and my son probably led him to commit suicide in July 1999. My son was a little less than two years then,"" Aruna recounted.There was worse to come. Sujoy's parents blamed Aruna for his HIV status and consequent suicide. She and the toddler were thrown out of the house. With advice from doctors, the mother-son got themselves checked and found that they were both infected. Since then they have been living with Aruna's parents in Baguiati.""My world came crumbling down for the second time when we both tested positive for HIV. My son became really ill in 2004. But Dr Subhashis Bhattacharya, who works at the apex clinic in Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, came as a godsend. He not only helped us with the treatment but supported us mentally through counseling. He made us believe that AIDS is not the end of the world,"" Aruna told TOI.Aruna's elder brother and parents stood rock solid behind her. Aruna, who is a science graduate, gives private tuition to fund his son's education. Debaditya is preparing for his Class X board examination. ""I am very positive about life. Come what may, I do not let HIV affect my life. But I do not want my friends to come to know about it as the infection is still a taboo for many. I only wish no one gets the infection for none of their fault,"" Debaditya said.""The amount of grit and courage Aruna has is incredible. In spite of being HIV-positive, she is not only bringing up her HIV-positive son single-handedly, but is also ensuring good education for him,"" said Dr Bhattacharya, a paediatric HIV specialist with NACO.Aruna and Debaditya are getting their anti-retroviral therapy free of cost, but she is concerned for her son's future. Often she has to seek financial help from NGOs for his education. ""The expenses of my son's education will only grow as he graduates into higher class. My earning through private tuitions is too meagre and irregular at times. I want a job but I do not know who would offer me one. Also will any organisation give me a job if they know my HIV status?"" wondered Aruna.While teaching the chapter on HIV in biology Aruna does not forget to tell her students never to indulge in unprotected sex.

The mom-to-be, who hails from the Old Town area, discovered to her horror that she had tested positive for HIV/AIDS What unfolded thereafter was nothing short of a tragedy. The child she gave birth to was born HIV positive and died within weeks of birth. Her husband Raju (name changed), whom she married in 2008 and was one who allegedly passed on the infection to her, died a few months ago because of infections generally associated with the disease.Now Sujatha's family members have lodged a police complaint with the One Town police station against Raju's family, alleging that he deliberately hid his HIV status at the time of marriage and infected an innocent woman. They are demanding that Raju's family bear the cost of Sujata's treatment, as she hails from a not so well-to-do family.""She is on ARV (anti-retroviral drugs) and her monthly medicine bill alone comes to about Rs 3000. The drugs along with other medicines and nutritional food are very costly. She was infected by her husband and now it is their turn to take care of her,"" her mother Savitri said.Similar cases of persons getting married without disclosing his or her health status are on the rise. Recently, another such case came to light in a very well-known and affluent family. Luckily the bride's parents came to know about the groom's HIV positive status on the wedding morning and demanded he undergo a medical test due to which he was caught, says Dr Kutikuppla Surya Rao, a doctor who has been treating HIV/AIDS affected since the last two decades.But most cases do not come to light due to the stigma attached to the disease. In fact, police officials at One Town station admitted that Sujata's was the first such case to be lodged with them. ""We are aware of such things and will not hesitate to book a case but most people do not come forward as stigma of being HIV/AIDS positive still prevails. Things can change only when people come out of their shell and lodge a complaint,"" said an official of One Town police station.For several years, this has been the subject of a raging debate - should both the bride and the groom be made to undergo HIV/AIDS test before marriage?""This issue was first raised at a NACO summit chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2001. The discussion then moved to Parliament but never translated into an Act or rule. It has been watered down to the level that if an innocent woman or man is infected by his or her partner, then he or she can lodge a complaint in the police station or file a case for compensation or treatment charges. But that is not sufficient in the present condition,"" pointed out Dr Surya Rao.The medical practitioner says that such cases have been on the rise and he has seen about 30 to 40 such cases in the last two years. ""In a majority of the cases, it has been men infecting women, with just a few stray cases the other way around. And 80 per cent of them were aware of their HIV status. Being aware and then getting married is a crime. Though 2012 is considered to be a path breaking year for HIV/AIDS research as the treatment is moving from prevention phase to cure status, it is still a crime to infect another purposefully. There is, however, no problem if two positive persons get married,"" he said.Though as per a NACO report the prevalence of HIV/AIDS is on the decline, Dr G Prabhakar of Green Vision pointed out that the decline was being witnessed in high risk group such as commercial sex workers (CSWs), truckers and migrant workers. ""The worrying factor is that the growing promiscuity among youth has led to an upswing in the incidence of the disease in the middle and affluent classes. Though there is no survey to establish this fact, as a medical practitioner actively involved in this segment, I think there has been a growth of at least 10 per cent over the last decade,"" said Dr Prabhakar.On the occasion of World AIDS Day on Saturday, the Port City is hosting a number of awareness programmes in tune with this year's theme of 'Getting to zero'. As per the theme, the aim is to achieve zero figure in various areas such as - new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS related deaths' for period 2011-15.Addressing the media here on Friday, additional district medical health officer (AIDS and Leprosy) Ronanki Ramesh said that AP has around five lakh HIV positive persons, of which 5.78 per cent are from Vizag district alone.Kutikuppala Surya Rao, a medical practitioner, who had been treating the HIV/AIDS-infected and affected in the city, said the focus this time was on the student community to raise awareness levels as education plays a vital role in creating awareness. As part of this, a first of its kind human AIDS red ribbon chain would be formed at the campus of Government College for Women at 10 am on Saturday. Apart from this, a 40 feet high burning red ribbon would be displayed there.Meanwhile, the district medical, health and family welfare department in collaboration with the Greater Visakha Municipal Corporation (GVMC) is also organising a rally at 9 am from GVMC to Jagadamba on the occasion. Around 500 nursing students are expected to participate in the rally apart from female sex workers.""A public meeting will also be held from 10.30 am and will be addressed by the district collector and chairman of district AIDS Prevention and Control Committee V Seshadri in the presence of GVMC commissioner,"" Ramesh said.","['hivaids', 'knots', 'hiv', 'positive', 'grooms', 'tying', 'medical', 'aids', 'zero', 'status', 'sorrow', 'family', 'cases', 'district']","The child she gave birth to was born HIV positive and died within weeks of birth.

The prevalence of HIV among pregnant women in the seven coastal districts combined is 0.81 per cent, which is more than the state average of 0.77 per cent.As per AP State AIDS Control Society (APSACS) data, the highest prevalence of HIV among pregnant women is in Kadapa (2.25 %), followed by the coastal district of East Godavari (1.25 per cent). In Krishna (1 %), Guntur (1.08 %) and West Godavari it is close to the state average. Vizag, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam are however a little lower than the state average.Project director of APSACS C Partha Sarathi said, ""We have given special focus on prevention of new infections from pregnant women to newborns during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding. The vertical (mother to child) transmission rate without any medication is around 30 per cent. During the last National Aids Control Programme (NACP), we were able to bring down this transmission rate to about 10 per cent with single dose Nevirapine prophylaxis in the mother-baby pairs. But AP is now piloting the superior triple drug regime, which aims at bringing down the HIV infection in newborns to around three per cent.""Recently, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka launched the PPTCT (prevention of parent to child transmission) 'triple drug regimen'. ""There will be a paradigm shift with the triple-drug regimen. The state is now looking forward to bringing down the mother-to-child transmission to zero,"" said state epidemiologist K Jaya Krishna and deputy director (monitoring, evaluation and surveillance), APSACS.Ronanki Ramesh, additional district medical and health officer (AIDS and leprosy), Visakhapatnam, said, ""Around 85 per cent of HIV transmission happens due to unsafe sex, while around 15 per cent is passed on from the pregnant mother to the child. It's now possible to stop vertical transmission by 98 per cent with the use of a combination of three ARV drugs starting from 14 weeks of pregnancy irrespective of CD4 count till the end of breastfeeding that is up to one or one and a half years. Soon after delivery, the infant will be given Nevarapine syrup for six weeks to be followed up for DBS-PCR tests till 18 months. The triple drug regimen under Mamta Plus programme also spikes the risk of drug resistance,"" he stated.AP is planning to give special importance to counselling and testing programme in the coming year and has set a target for 35 lakh tests (including 15 lakhs pregnant women).Overall, according to APSACS, new infections are on the decline in the state with an approximately 23 per cent decline in new infections being recorded in 2009 in comparison to 2006.

As things turned out, she got married and got infected. The husband is no more but there’s her, two children and the virus.In a country where people living with AIDS are still subjected to ostracism, a lone HIV positive woman with two children did not really stand a chance. But there is something to be said about sheer grit. If you have it, even gunny bags can give you a lease of life. In Sangeeta’s case, the gunny bags came with something even more precious – dignity. The feisty lady has received a bulk contract from a Kalka-based company to sew gunny bags for Rs 4,000 month. On World Aids Day, nine women living with AIDS joined her to make a living sewing gunny bags. She calls women living with AIDS on her mobile phone. One, she proudly points out, she bought herself.At 31, Saumya is treading the same path. Like Sangeeta, Saumya lost her husband, who was HIV positive. Unlike Sangeeta, the legacy she received included not only HIV but also TB. It was not possible for her to work anywhere till people from the drop-in-centre approached her to help her earn by stitching gunny bags. She is also trying to reach out to women deprived of care when they need it the most. “I have seen the vicissitudes of life and I am trying to guide women suffering the same way,” she said.It was Archana, in-charge of the drop-in-centre who conceived the idea of helping women with the craft of making polybags. Archana, who lives with AIDS herself, plans to expand operations to include more women in the ambit of the self-sustaining group.“We went to Anandpur Sahib a few days ago where we saw women working on recycled paper for a well known company. Though the marketing was not impressive, it generated Rs 1,500 per month. We decided to modify the concept and raise income for the women,” she said.While the centre has a special machine to imprint the names that buyers want, they also plan to buy a machine which can be used to make disposable cups and glasses. “With these self employment schemes, we will expand services to all 100 women living with HIV in the city,” said Archana.","['positive', 'hiv', 'aids', 'sew', 'lives', 'selfreliant', 'join', 'forces', 'gunny', 'women', 'archana', 'trying', 'living', 'bags', 'sangeeta']","CHANDIGARH: AIDS would have remained a distant notion for 34-year-old Sangeeta, had the man she married told her he was HIV positive .

They accused the Bihar State AIDS Control Society (BSACS) of ill-treating the HIV positive people.There are around 12,000 people with AIDS in Bihar, while another 55,000 are HIV positive.
The largest numbers of HIV positive people are in Patna district.

The condition of such patients, who stop responding to Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART), continues to deteriorate despite restarting earlier medication. So, they need to be put on the second line of ART treatment.“We keep telling patients at every visit not to miss medicines. But some of them do land up with first line failure and have to be put on second line. GMCH started this facility last year. The viral load in these patients is extremely high. We identify them, send them to Mumbai to assess viral load, and if they need second line ART, they are put on it immediately,” said professor and head of medicine at GMCH Dr YB Bansod.Second line of ART is available at only five centres in the state, at the government medical colleges in Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad, Nagpur and Sangli. Till October this year, total 1,546 patients were on second line. City has second line ART centre at GMCH, where 144 patients; 124 men, 17 women and 3 children, are being treated.Patients say that lack of awareness, carelessness, casual attitude and poverty play a big role in the discontinuation of medicine, leading to second line treatment.Kalabai was told of her positive status during pregnancy tests at GMCH. Since she was put on mother to child prevention drugs, her son is negative. Being poor, she had taken shelter in a missionary ashram for some time, and has now left her son there to study.Others on second line have similar experiences. Sunita from Yavatmal was accompanying her husband who is on second line. “I didn’t feed my daughter . I am also positive, but my daughter is not. I work as a maid to keep the family going since my husband gave up his job as a driver. He caught HIV from sexual relationships while away on the job,” she said in a choked voice.Surekha (51) from Umrer tested positive only after her husband died, and is now on second line. Her two grown up sons take care of her. Ramratan, from a village near Pandhurna, admits he had sexual relations with CSWs, which led to the HIV. “Now, I have no means of earning my daily bread. My brother supports me with food and travel charges,” he said.Subhash from Jharkhand, now a resident of Nagpur, too admits he had multiple sexual partners while working as a driver. Put on second line about four months back, he has brought his family to Nagpur and told his wife and children about having tested positive for HIV.Surprisingly, Sanjiv Waghmare, a sanitary worker, claims that he never missed his medicine, and yet landed up with failure of first line. “I had an alarm in the mobile and would stop anywhere to take the medicine when it rang. God knows why I still developed resistance,” he said.","['hiv', 'positive', 'medicine', 'life', 'patients', 'second', 'sexual', 'nagpur', 'husband', 'art', 'gmch', 'line', 'gives']","So, they need to be put on the second line of ART treatment.“We keep telling patients at every visit not to miss medicines.

Zero discrimination” may have been the theme of the World AIDS Day on Saturday.But for Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad , it’s an unreachable target in the near future. He has strongly contradicted the global theme. The minister told TOI “in no way can India achieve such a target in the near future. In fact no country can do so.” “Zero discrimination”, according to him, is a far cry.On Friday, Azad told Parliament that discrimination is rampant in India.The minister said the operational guidelines for ART services clearly mention that “irrespective of HIV status of a person, all patients are entitled to receive general and special out patient and inpatient services in a hospital.”He added that “confidentiality should be maintained at all levels irrespective of HIV status as per medical ethics and the law.” But he admitted that cases of discrimination “are reported from time to time”.According to him, in the last three years, 21 cases of discrimination have been reported – nine from Karnataka, Delhi (4), Madhya Pradesh (3), Bihar (2) and Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Odisha (1 each).Around 11 cases of suicides by HIV/AIDS patients have also been reported during the same time – 6 from Karnataka, Gujarat (3) and Delhi and Tamil Nadu (1 each) to the state grievance redressal committees.North Indian states, he felt, need to follow the example of their southern counterparts in controlling HIV.“North India has been slow to address the HIV threat. Southern states have done better,” said Azad.New HIV infections in children are down, but reaching the goal of an AIDS-free generation requires that more HIV+ pregnant women receive antiretroviral treatment to decrease the risk of infection for their babies, said Unicef on Saturday.In India over 14,000 children got infected last year — a 13% decline from 2009. The number of estimated deaths among children (0-14 age group) due to AIDS was 10,213 in 2011.The total number of people living with HIV in the country has seen a decline from approximately 2.3 million to 2.1 million. The drop has been much higher among men (16%) than women (2.6%).“Thanks to remarkable global commitment, the world has seen a 24% reduction in new HIV infections in children – from 430,000 in 2009 to 330,000 in 2011. Much progress has been made in the field of treatment. In low and middle-income countries, coverage of effective antiretroviral treatment for preventing mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) reached 57% in 2011,” Unicef added.Regarding access to treatment of children in need, it increased from 6% in 2006, when the pediatric HIV programme was launched in India to 34% last year.“It is simply wrong that adults are twice as likely as children to receive the treatment they need,” said Anthony Lake , executive director of Unicef. “By definition, an AIDS-free generation depends on protecting the youngest and most vulnerable from HIV infection. We must do still more to help mothers and children who live with HIV be able to live free from AIDS.We must rededicate ourselves to boosting the number of pregnant women and children being tested and treated through basic antenatal and child health programmes,” he added.","['zero', 'positive', 'hiv', 'discrimination', 'unrealistic', 'receive', 'children', 'patients', 'unicef', 'reported', 'world', 'women', 'ghulam', 'india', 'target', 'treatment', 'nabi']","NEW DELHI: “Getting to Zero: Zero new HIV infections.

She was pregnant when she found out that her husband was HIV positive and had concealed the information from her. Betrayed, she came back. The bigger shock came when pregnancy tests revealed that her husband had passed the virus on to her.""I had seen my husband remain ill all the time because of HIV. When I came to India, I consulted a doctor who put me on Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) right away and asked me to have a nutritious diet. I made it my mantra. Except for normal coughs and colds, which normal people suffer during changes of season, I have not remained ill,"" says Manisha.Manisha says her good health prompted her to start a beauty parlour in partnership with her best friend. ""I feel very energetic and have never felt sick. My attitude towards HIV has changed through my own experience"", says Manisha.Infectious diseases specialist Dr Atul Patel, who was one of the first private practitioners to dedicate himself to treating HIV, says viral load becomes undetectable in patients on ART therapy after just six months of treatment.""With this treatment, only the diagnostic test tells if a person is HIV positive. Otherwise, viral load becomes undetectable in the blood,"" says Dr Patel.""I have a number of patients who have been treated for the last 10 years and a few have lived for more than 12-14 years! My oldest patient is a 96-year old gentleman who has been living healthily with HIV for 12 years,"" says Dr Patel.He says that most patients who have done well have followed their treatments well, have paid attention to what they eat, and more importantly, have had good family support.""Good family support somehow adds years and cuts down the illness"", says Dr Patel.Ahmedabad: When you first meet Manoj Parmar, 31, he appears healthy, with a wide, infectious smile.

""I was helpless and didn't know who to turn to for advice.

But her early childhood was one of hardship and there are many out in the community in want of attention.According to Berlin Jose , founder-director of Russ Foundation, each of these children have a story of their own, but have successfully come out of their trauma and are doing well in the mainstream education system. Chittu for example was born to a female sex worker who made her income on the streets of Madurai. The woman who had a partner who was already married and had two children, was being used by him to make money. When she became sick and realized she was going to die of AIDS, she brought her three-year-old child, who was already begging on the streets of Madurai, to the home for adoption. She died a few days later. Her partner, however, who could not prove that he was the biological father of this child, was reluctant to give up the child because he had already chalked out plans to make money by making her beg. ""We went through a tough battle with him before the authorities handed her over to us,"" said Jose.Initially, the girl's stomach which was used to scavenging on food on the roadside, could not tolerate the well cooked warm food offered at the home. This HIV positive child suffered frequent bouts of diarrhoea. Staff at the home sometimes found her searching garbage bins for food and feeding on leftovers. ""It took us two whole months to bring her around and now she is doing very well in a normal school,"" he said.Apart from the children of the home, the foundation also works with 77 HIV positive children living in the community and about 650 non-infected children of HIV positive parents.This foundation has been able to successfully integrate HIV positive girls and boys into mainstream society, by their regular counseling and life skills classes. But according to Jose, girls more than boys face a lot of trauma on attaining puberty because society tries to stigmatize them as immoral persons. ""This is when they start hating their parents who are no longer alive. These girls become suicidal and depressed and need a lot of handholding to start realizing their potential as good individuals in society,"" he said.Boys on the other hand start thinking of life ahead and a future.

The cloth-like fibres can be woven from medicine into extremely thin ‘webs’ . They are then designed to dissolve after use, either within minutes or over several days.The team was given $1 million to develop the technology, which uses an electric field to charge fluid through air to create the very fine , nanometre-sized fibres . “Our dream is to create a product women can use to protect themselves from HIV and unintended pregnancy,” Kim Woodrow, a UW assistant professor of bioengineering, said.“We have the drugs to do that. It’s really about delivering them in a way that makes them more potent , and allows a woman to want to use it,” Woodrow said. “This method allows controlled release of multiple compounds.

However, a year later, still unhappy with his fate, he's coping well and feels that the early detection, though unintended, saved his life.What happened to Prakhar brings to fore the grim reality of high prevalence of HIV positive people in the state who are ignorant of their status.Data provided by Chhattisgarh State AIDS Control Society ( CSACS ) reveals that of the total people who donated blood in 2011 in the state as many as 157 were found to be HIV positive. These people were not aware of the fact that they were carriers of the deadly virus. The detections happened as the donated blood is mandatorily tested for HIV virus and is completely destroyed, if found infected.Statistics show that there are 16 government and 22 private blood banks in the state, which collect blood through camps and also through replacements. Last year, 8185 units of blood was collected in camps and 50,132 people donated voluntarily.Of the 50,132 voluntary donations, 157 donors were found positive for HIV, implying that one out of every 320 people were carriers of the AIDS virus. According to the Chhattisgarh State Aids Control Society, transfusion of HIV-infected blood is also a major reason for transmission of the virus.The society stated that one should take blood only from a licensed blood bank where it is tested for HIV.In 2008, around 10,534 people had donated blood out of which 145 were tested HIV positive. In 2009 this figure increased to 150, from 24,164 donors. In 2010, of the 49,458 blood donations 154 were found to be positive for HIV.To deal with the problem, the CSACS has taken the issue seriously and kick-started awareness campaigns on HIV/AIDS , interacting with people in their local dialects on the requisite precautions to be taken for the disease.","['positive', 'hiv', 'aids', 'blood', 'prakhar', '157', 'virus', 'tested', 'state', 'society', 'donated', 'donors']","RAIPUR: Like any well-meaning citizen, Prakhar (name changed), a young man in his mid 20s, went to donate blood at a camp last year to fulfill his social responsibility.

Tears roll down her cheeks but her words are full of determination. ""I know I am old but I will strive for my grandson till my last breath. It is my duty. I will make him strong enough to take life in his stride before I die,"" she says.There were many grandparents sharing similar stories at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) on Tuesday during a programme organized by the medicine department's ART (antiretroviral therapy) centre to felicitate children living with HIV/AIDS and encourage them to continue taking medicines and bring a feeling of belongingness in them.Sushma Kathare, grandmother of Kumar who works as farm labourer in Waddhamna, brings her grandson religiously to GMCH once a month.

""I live in Mumbai while my mother lives in Azamgarh district in Uttar Pradesh.

""Here, a mother has given a kidney to her son.

This is the first child — and only the second HIV-infected person — to have been cured of the disease, if the claim announced on Sunday by a research team from Johns Hopkins Children’s Center (JHCC) and the University of Massachusetts Medical School is found to be true.The team hoped that the success could be replicated in other children born with HIV which would pave the way for eliminating the disease among children. HIV-related breakthroughs are rare and finding a vaccine has been a daunting challenge thanks to the ability of the virus to slip through.The researchers put a Mississippi-born infant, whose mother is HIV-positive, to antiretroviral therapy (ART) within 30 hours of birth. The prompt administration led to the cure by halting the formation of hard-to-treat viral reservoirs — dormant cells responsible for reigniting the infection in most HIV patients within weeks of stopping the therapy.A series of tests showed progressively diminishing viral presence in the infant's blood, until it reached undetectable levels 29 days after birth.The infant remained on antivirals till 18 months of age. Ten months after the treatment was discontinued, the child underwent repeated blood tests, none of which detected HIV. Test for HIV-specific antibodies — the infection’s standard clinical indicator — also remained negative throughout.“Prompt ART in newborns that begins within days of exposure may help infants clear the virus and achieve long-term remission without lifelong treatment by preventing such viral hideouts from forming in the first place,” said JHCC virologist Deborah Persaud “Our next step is to find out if this is a highly unusual response to very early antiretroviral therapy or something we can actually replicate in other high-risk newborns,” Persaud added.The only other HIV-positive person to be cured was Timothy Brown , a middle-aged man with leukemia who got cured after receiving a bone-marrow transplant from a donor genetically resistant to HIV infection.In the current case, the New York Times cited experts saying they needed convincing that the baby had truly been infected in the first place. “If not, this would be a case of prevention, something already done for babies born to infected mothers,” it reported. Other experts were quoted as saying that the findings in the baby would probably not be relevant to adults.The researchers said they did not have enough data at the moment to recommend changes to the current practice of using preventive rather than therapeutic treatment for high-risk infants.They said complete viral eradication on a large scale was their long-term goal. “But, for now, (it) remains out of reach, and our best chance may come from aggressive, timely and precisely targeted use of antiviral therapies in high-risk newborns as a way to achieve functional cure,” the researchers said in their report.Functional cure allows a patient to be free of the HIV virus without lifelong treatment, besides preventing HIV replication in the blood. In this case, viral presence is so minimal that it remains undetectable by standard clinical tests. It is discernible only through ultrasensitive methods.“Prevention really is the best cure, and we already have proven strategies that can prevent 98% of newborn infections by identifying and treating HIV-positive pregnant women,” the report said.The UN estimates that 330,000 babies were infected in 2011. This is apart from more than three million children living with HIV around the world. In India, more than 14,000 children got infected in 2011, which accounted for 13% decline compared to 2009. The number of estimated deaths among children (0-14 years old) due to AIDS was 10,213 in 2011.A latest UNAIDS Global HIV Epidemic Report revealed that 72% HIV-infected children in India and South East Asia do not have access to treatment.In India, children accounted for 7% of an estimated 21 lakh people living with HIV/AIDS in 2011. Around 40% (8.16 lakh) of them were women, who are likely to pass on the virus to their children.","['hiv', 'children', 'doctors', 'childrens', 'viral', 'virus', 'hopkins', 'claims', 'center', 'researchers', 'infected', 'infant', 'cured', 'team', 'johns', 'treatment', 'cure', 'tests']","Ten months after the treatment was discontinued, the child underwent repeated blood tests, none of which detected HIV.

Inevitably, they ran into barriers. But determined to fight and overcome all odds, these young Muslim activists of Kalyan Red Ribbon Club (RRC) have today ushered in a silent revolution in this village. This includes an outreach strategy to address HIV+ prevention, care and support and treatment in this vulnerable district.Talking about sex was virtually taboo in this village, so for young Muslim girls, mostly in their teens, initiating any discussion on the issue was to invite controversy. But that is what Amina Khatoon, a 17-year-old girl, has done ever since she was made president of the 70-member RRC. She comes from a poor family and also works as a part-time dressmaker. April 14, 2009, was a memorable day for Amina when Nirdesh (an NGO) link worker Kumkum Kumari, formed the Kalyan Red Ribbon Club (KRRC) at the village with 21 girls. Prior to this, these girls had never come out in the open without ‘purdah’ and mingled with each other freely. The most sensitive and important issue about which they learnt was the disastrous effect of HIV/AIDS “I had to make a huge effort to make these girls understand the challenge of HIV/AIDS, particularly in rural areas, as here it becomes more pronounced in view of stigma and discrimination surrounding HIV, resulting in poor access to health care, and, above all, infections going undetected or treated by unqualified practitioners,” said Kumkum.Soon these girls started spreading awareness about prevention and protection from HIV/AIDS among the rural community. They were also imparted training at various places, which changed their outlook and provided them a broader vision. The effort made by these girls was soon recognized by Unicef too. The girls were then provided a sewing machine and a ceiling fan. Today these girls, apart from generating social awareness are also learning skills like stitching, puppet-making, hosiery making etc to make their life better.KRRC is constantly expanding its base and now has 70 members, of which 20 are young boys. Sajda, Naznin, Momina, Shaba, Ruksana, Raksa, Mohd Raja, Aftab… all are enthusiastically involved in their assignments.

""After two days, I was asked to resume treatment for HIV, even though I had visited the hospital for my mouth ulcer. They said it won't be of any use till my HIV was controlled. When I asked if I could continue treatment at the hospital, they refused and asked me to leave,"" said Tariq, a resident of Rajabazar.In immense pain and barely able to speak, Tariq was taken to a private hospital by neighbours on Wednesday. He received blood transfusion at the hospital and got his first dose of chemotherapy on Sunday. Doctors said his oral cancer needs greater attention now, for his HIV is under control. ""HIV might have triggered the oral cancer. Often, it causes lymphoma, oral cancer or cancer in the genitals. But contrary to what he was told at the government hospital, Tariq's ulcer needs to be treated now. It seems he was shooed away due to his HIV status,"" said Ashish Mukhopadhyay, who is treating him. Although his condition was serious, Tariq was still in a state to receive palliative therapy that could keep him reasonably healthy for a few more years, he added.Deserted by his wife, Tariq is now looked after by his two brothers. He has not been able to work for the last six months. ""With each passing month, he has been getting weaker. As if the HIV was not bad enough, he got oral cancer six months ago. The pain has been excruciating and he has barely been able to eat. But the treatment at the government hospitals was shocking. They just refused to treat him,"" said Mohammed Moin, his brother-in-law.RG Kar authorities, on the other hand, argued that HIV-positive patients are often asked to continue treatment for the virus when they seek redress for another ailment.""As the rules say, HIV patients are treated on a par with others. We are not permitted to disclose their HIV status even to the hospital staff. But we must handle them carefully, for they are carrying a contagious virus. So, we often advise them to make sure that they continue their treatment for HIV and are referred to our HIV centre. Strangely, patients often take this as refusal. I am not aware of Tariq's case, but it seems unlikely that he was shooed away just because he had the disease. At any given point of time, RG Kar has at least 8 to 10 HIV patients who are being treated alongside the rest,"" said Ajoy Ray, medical superintendent of RG Kar.The West Bengal Aids Control and Prevention Society said it was illegal to either refuse treatment or turn away an HIV patient. ""In case we receive a complaint, we shall investigate the matter,"" said Himadri Sekhar Sanyal, the deputy project manager of the society.Mukhopadhyay pointed out that while Tariq needed to carry on his HIV treatment, his oral cancer (buccalmucosa carcinoma) was worsening and might have caused death. ""Without chemotherapy, he wouldn't have survived more than a few months more,"" he said.","['hospital', 'hiv', 'asked', 'patients', 'shoos', 'bengal', 'tariq', 'cancer', 'kar', 'away', 'patient', 'govt', 'oral', 'treatment', 'rg']","KOLKATA: Campaigns and awareness programmes seem to have done little to change the city's skewed attitude towards HIV patients .

Passing orders on the appeal filed by lorry driver P Ravikumar, the judge said that in 1955 when the Hindu Marriage Act came into existence, HIV was not heard of. However, as per Section 13(v) of the Act if a spouse is suffering from a venereal disease in a communicable form, it is a valid ground for divorce, he said.Justice Ramanathan, noting that he had perused materials available on the internet, concluded that HIV infection being a communicable health hazard, a person testing positive for the virus should be considered an acceptable ground for divorce.“In the year 1955, HIV was not heard of and, therefore, it was not named in the Hindu Marriage Act as one of the grounds for dissolution of marriage. But having regard for the fact that venereal disease in a communicable form has been mentioned as one of the grounds for divorce, any such disease will also come under the provision of the Section 13(v). Therefore, it cannot be contended that HIV-positive condition is not included under the section and therefore divorce cannot be granted,” Justice Ramanathan said.The matter relates to the matrimonial dispute between the couple from Sankagiri in Salem district. On an application from Ravikumar, a sub-court dissolved their marriage on April 3, 2007. However, hearing the appeal filed by his wife, the additional district court in Salem on January 31, 2008 ruled that divorce cannot be granted. Ravikumar then approached the high court.When the matter was taken up for hearing, his wife’s counsel denied that she was HIV-positive and argued that since her husband was a driver visiting various places during his duty, if at all she is afflicted with HIV, she must have got it only through her husband. While the Hindu Marriage Act had specifically stated that venereal diseases in a communicable form could be a ground for divorce, it had not said anywhere that HIV-positive condition could be a ground for dissolution of a marriage. The divorce plea of Ravikumar, therefore, is not maintainable, she submitted.However, when the court asked the couple to undergo tests at the Government General Hospital in Chennai, Ravikumar alone complied with the order. His wife refused to undergo any tests voluntarily, despite two directives from the court.","['hiv', 'court', 'act', 'venereal', 'divorce', 'hivpositive', 'ground', 'equates', 'grants', 'ravikumar', 'hindu', 'disease', 'man', 'marriage']","Passing orders on the appeal filed by lorry driver P Ravikumar, the judge said that in 1955 when the Hindu Marriage Act came into existence, HIV was not heard of.

HaiSitaMukhopadhyaySandeepDilipKurjiGougheducationistsShankerDuttMunibaVeliathVandanaNairSanatSinhaParveenAmanullahBharatiyaNrityaKalaMandirMaidanIACMThis Sunday evening on May 19, 2013, people from all walks of life will participate in the memorial service, which falls on the third Sunday of May. It is a day dedicated to the memory of those lost to HIV and AIDS. The lighting of the candle is an important part of the ritual. ""What's the use of lighting a candle?"" scoffed a sit- at- the- computer smart-aleck-Facebook troll.On that hot summer night of 2001, the 'official' HIV figures in Bihar stood at 35 infected and 1 death. That night, in the glow of the red candles, it was revealed that some 900 people had tested positive during the past five years, and this was with data from just Sens' Lab and Kurji Holy Family Hospital . This news appeared widely in the local press. It, of course, embarrassed the Bihar State AIDS Control Society (BSACS) people who had also come to the 'show', carrying a large BSACS banner.Those red candles flickering in the summer breeze challenged the opaque darkness of ignorance and apathy. A stunned BSACS spokesperson could only say, ""These are not government figures. We don't include data from private hospitals."" The lameness of the retort was self-evident. As a direct consequence, under the leadership of CK Anil, BSACS began improving services and surveillance. When the next IACM was held a year later, BSACS reporting had greatly improved, voluntary counselling and testing centres were being set up, and 1097 HIV/AIDS helplines had been set up.In 2002, the candles brought to light the issues of silence and stigma. They brought to the fore two things: one, that HIV infections were closer to middle class Bihar than reported, and two, that the obsolete Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code was obstructing the battle against HIV and AIDS. Giving the keynote address was a young Bihar-born activist lawyer named Aditya Bandhopadhyay, who was defending the workers of the Naz Foundation International (NFI) in Lucknow, who had been arrested for 'abetting unnatural offences' by distributing condoms and running a sexual health and AIDS prevention centre for non-heterosexual males. 'Integration', one of Kolkata's pioneering Queer Rights groups, performed at the Memorial. It was this year that a symbolic 'Reading of the Names' was started: speaking the names of people lost to HIV and AIDS. The list had some 25 names, people lost to AIDS who were close to the participants and organizers.In 2003, the Memorial had its first transgender guest of honour, Lallan Hijra, who introduced into the Bihar HIV AIDS narrative the voices of the marginalized. She spoke of the trauma of accessing medical services of any kind; how 'hijras' were generally treated like dirt by doctors and nurses alike. She said if Bihar opened its eyes to the fact that transgenders would always be there, and let them access education and skills in peace, they wouldn't be a community forced to dance and beg and be vulnerable to HIV and AIDS. Arriving that day to light the Memorial candle were Arif Jafar and Shivananda Khan. Arif Jafar was the person arrested in the NFI Lucknow case, and he spoke of how media insensitivity and sensationalism coupled with misuse of Section 377 by the police would only cripple society further. The candles also shone on another dark corner, the fate of street children.And so on, year after year, aware and concerned citizens come to light candles in the memory of those lost to HIV and AIDS. We have lit them when Bihar continued to be in denial, hiding under the cloak of being a 'low incidence state', ignoring the stark reality of high migration of labour and the non-availability of testing at district level. We lighted them as realization dawned that Bihar was a 'vulnerable state'. Over the years we have lit candles with sadness as the people lost to AIDS have become familiar, and we have lit them with hope as people with HIV have gained the courage to come out of the darkness of anonymity and speak for themselves.Tonight the candles glow to remind us that HIV is no longer a ticket to death, if only the required ART treatment is made accessible and affordable. They glow to announce that since 2012, we can claim that some 95 children out of every 100 are born HIV free to infected mothers, thanks to the ART regimen for pregnant HIV positive women. They will glow to dispel the myth that HIV is spread through a razor blade. They also light up the fact that there are more than 55,000 HIV positive children, women and men recorded so far in Bihar, and most still face discrimination and stigma.That is why every candle that flickers in the wind is so very important.","['hiv', 'bihar', 'aids', 'light', 'red', 'candle', 'bsacs', 'bihars', 'narrative', 'lost', 'memorial', 'candles', 'glow']","It is a day dedicated to the memory of those lost to HIV and AIDS.

As per records, only 60-70 HIV positive people in these tribal areas are living on anti-retroviral drugs (ART), though there are around 8,000 such patients on ART drugs in the entire district.

Health officials observed that more number of students and people who plan to marry are voluntarily coming forward for HIV testing in urban areas these days when compared to a few years ago when very few opted for the same either out of fear or due to the stigma attached to the disease. Students account for 25-30% of those who are voluntarily opting for HIV testing now, they said.“Screening for HIV before marriage should be made mandatory to check the spread of the disease. Awareness generation for taking precautions is more important than diagnosis and treatment because it’s a deadly disease and once someone gets affected there’s no cure. Pregnant women are tested but their husbands should also come forward for testing,” said Dr Sarada Bai, gynaecologist, King George Hospital.Nowadays, with improved treatment regime and drugs, risk of vertical transmission from mother to child can also be minimised. But vulnerable or affected people shouldn’t shy away from getting diagnosed and treated as it could spread the disease and risk the lives of others,” said the gynaecologist.“Around a year ago, there were just four testing centres in the Agency areas in Araku, Paderu, Chintapalli, and Munchingput but now 45 primary health centres (PHCs) located in tribal or Agency areas have Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs). They have screening kits, counsellors and lab technicians to detect HIV cases,” said additional district medical and health officer (AIDS and leprosy) Ronanki Ramesh.“Still, very few come for screening because of illiteracy, lack of awareness and stigma. Also, as the migrant population and high risk groups aren’t much in these areas, the incidence of HIV is also below 1% unlike in urban areas where it is 2-3%,” said Ramesh.“We are now focusing on ante-natal women and TB patients, as they are the HIV vulnerable group in tribal areas, and are also undertaking screening of husbands. In Paderu region, 30 people were put on ART, while the figure is even less in other Agency areas that have a total of 30-40 people on ART drugs. As for the urban areas, the number of HIV cases put on ART is as high as 8,000,” said Ramesh.“However, the overall incidence is coming down. Five to six years ago, there used to be 7-8 HIV positive cases for every 100 persons in the high-risk groups which has now come down to 2 or 3. High-risk groups include sex workers, truckers, migrant population, transgender and gays,” said Ramesh.“There also seems to be a change in the mindset of the youth and student community especially after red ribbon campaigns were launched in colleges. Those planning to get married or donate blood are coming forward for HIV testing in the three ART centres in King George Hospital (the nodal centre), Anakapalle and Chest Hospital. Earlier, they might have indulged in unsafe sex out of curiosity or peer pressure but don’t want to take the risk now. They are given counselling and asked to practise safe sex,” said Ramesh.P Jaikanth, an engineering graduate, welcomed this gradual change in the mindset among the youth. “Of late I see some of my acquaintances going on their own for HIV tests before marriage, which is a responsible behaviour on their part. But a lot needs to change where the stigma is concerned. HIV positive people shouldn’t be ostracized and society should take a live-and-let-live attitude towards HIV positive people,” he said.","['areas', 'hiv', 'hides', 'positive', 'testing', 'drugs', 'real', 'centres', 'tribal', 'risk', 'art', 'stigma', 'disease', 'picture', 'hamlets']","VISAKHAPATNAM: Reflecting the lack of awareness among tribals and higher prevalence of stigma and misinformation, very few HIV positive cases are being reported in the Agency areas of the district.

There is still no vaccine or cure for itScientists say developing an effective vaccine to prevent HIV infection is one of the most daunting challenges ever faced. One of the main reason for this is that HIV is an incredibly elusive virus.HIV is among the most mutating viruses.Scientists have long struggled to decipher how the HIV capsid shell is chemically put together.Senior author Peijun Zhang, department of structural biology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine said, ""The capsid is critically important for HIV replication , so knowing its structure in detail could lead us to new drugs that can treat or prevent the infection,"" she said.""This approach has the potential to be a powerful alternative to our current HIV therapies, which work by targeting certain enzymes, but drug resistance is an enormous challenge due to the virus' high mutation rate.""Previous research has shown that the cone-shaped shell is composed of identical capsid proteins linked together in a complex lattice.But the shell is non-uniform and asymmetrical; uncertainty remained about the exact number of proteins involved and how the hexagons of six protein subunits and pentagons of five subunits are joined.Standard structural biology methods to decipher the molecular architecture were insufficient because they rely on averaged data, collected on samples of pieces of the highly variable capsid to identify how these pieces tend to go together.""The capsid is very sensitive to mutation, so if we can disrupt those interfaces, we could interfere with capsid function,"" Dr Zhang said. ""The capsid has to remain intact to protect the HIV genome and get it into the human cell, but once inside it has to come apart to release its content so that the virus can replicate. Developing drugs that cause capsid dysfunction by preventing its assembly or disassembly might stop the virus from reproducing.""""By using a combination of experimental and computational approaches, this team of investigators has produced a clearer picture of the structure of HIV's protective covering,"" said the National Institutes of Health's Michael Sakalian.""The new structural details may reveal vulnerabilities that could be exploited by future therapeutics.""","['university', 'hiv', 'medicine', 'lead', 'school', 'hope', 'structural', 'vaccine', 'virus', 'zhang', 'shell', 'scientists', 'capsid', 'weakness', 'structure', 'pittsburgh', 'deciphered']","There is still no vaccine or cure for itScientists say developing an effective vaccine to prevent HIV infection is one of the most daunting challenges ever faced.

But because of his irregular visits to the hospital for the therapy, his CD4 count dropped drastically following which he was rushed to the medical college last month.The man was taken home after he became stable and admitted to STM two weeks back since he had become anaemic and was suffering from bouts of diarrhoea.The victim's family members said that he would often skip medicines and needed constant monitoring. His son was hence staying with him so that he could be looked after properly.According to the patient's son, he had fed him and given him all necessary medicines before putting him to sleep around 12 midnight. The son also slept thereafter. At 4.30am, he was woken up by a groaning sound and found his father lying on the floor with blood all around. His abdomen was split open and the intestines visible. A knife brought by the son to cut fruits was used to cut open the abdomen, said police.""Though the doctors attended to him immediately, the patient couldn't be revived as he had lost a lot of blood and the injury was grievous. He succumbed to the injury an hour later,"" said Dr Pradip Kumar Kundu, STM medical superintendent and vice principal.The patient was depressed and suffering from dementia, said doctors. Police believe he was unable to bear the sufferings and hence killed himself. ""The nature of injury appears to be self inflicted. We can confirm if it was suicide or homicide once we get the autopsy report,"" said a senior police officer of the detective department.A 46-year-old patient was found dead under mysterious circumstances at his hospital cabin in School of Tropical Medicine (STM) on Thursday morning. Though it is suspected as a case of suicide, police has registered a case of unnatural death and sent the body for post mortem.The HIV positive patient from Narkeldanga was getting treatment for a cabin at STM. His son too stayed with him at the same cabin to look after him. On hearing someone groaning in pain at the wee hours the son woke up to find his father lying on the floor in a pool of blood. He alerted the nurses on duty who called in the medical officer. Despite giving all emergency medical attention, the man succumbed to the injury.According to the son, he has fed his father and given all medications before putting him to sleep around 12 midnight. The son also slept after that. Around 4.30 am he was awakened by the sound of groaning. He woke up to find his father on the floor will blood all around. To the shock of the doctors who rushed in they found the abdomen of the patient slit deep and wide and his intestine had popped out.""He was attended immediately by our doctors. But the patient had lost so much of blood and the injury was so grievous that he could not revived. He succumbed to the injury about an hour later,"" said Dr Pradip Kumar Kundu, STM medical superintendent and vice principal.The patient was detected HIV positive a couple of years ago. He was on ART drugs for about eight months from Medical College and Hospital Calcutta. But due to his irregularities in going for the ART his CD 4 count had come down drastically as a result he was rushed to the said hospital about a month ago. He was then discharged after being treated for about a week. His family brought him to STM two weeks ago as he had become anaemic and suffered from bouts of diarrhoea.Family members said that the patient would skip medications if he was not monitored by someone. That is how his son stayed with him in the hospital to look after him. Doctors treating him also said that the patient was depressed and was also suffering from dementia. His condition had started improving slightly in the past one week.A knife brought by the son to cut fruit for the patient was used to cut open the abdomen of the patient. Police suspects that he was unable to bear with sufferings and hence took his own life.""The nature of injury appears to be self inflicted and hence it looks like a case of suicide.

The finding was published on Tuesday in the journal PLoS One.Testing the general population just once would cost $1,100 (approx 65,000) per year of life saved (YLS) in the general population, and $800 (47,000) per YLS among high-risk groups. Testing the population every five years would cost $1,900 (1.1lakh) per YLS saved in for the general public, and $1,300 (76,000) per YLS among high-risk groups.Researchers said the main benefit of national testing would be getting more people to learn they are positive and therefore to seek effective care. A secondary benefit would be to curb transmission of the virus.According to the team, the main results are projections of the dollar cost per year of extended life. The World Health Organization’s standard for cost effectiveness is an expenditure that is less than three times the per capita GDP of a country.In India in 2010, per capita GDP was $1,300. A programme is therefore cost-effective in India if the expense is less than $3,900 (2.2lakh) to save a year of someone’s life.They calculated that modern antiretroviral therapies can give HIV-positive people a normal lifespan. In India, which has a thriving generic pharmaceutical sector, first-line therapy costs only $8.61 (500) a month. HIV tests cost only $3.33 (195).The team coded several other parameters into the model including what percentage of people would refuse the test (18%), how many patients who test positive would get care (50%), the prevalence of HIV in the population (0.29%) and others.Jessica Becker of Yale University said, “We were able to show that even if you increase the cost of HIV treatment and care significantly, testing this frequently was reasonable.”Co-author Dr Soumya Swaminathan, director of the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis in Chennai, said the projections will help the country in its battle with the epidemic.“As India moves ahead in its HIV prevention activities and aims for zero new infections, expanding testing will be a priority and this analysis should help policymakers make the best decisions,” she said.","['hiv', 'study', 'cut', 'testing', 'test', 'pitches', 'general', 'population', 'yls', 'benefit', 'team', 'universal', 'chennaiyale', 'cost', 'india', 'care']","LONDON: Testing every person in India’s billion plus population for HIV will be cost effective, the first ever study on the benefit of universal HIV testing has found.A team of researchers from YRG Care in Chennai, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Brown, Yale and Harvard universities in the US has determined that providing universal HIV testing every five years would be a cost-effective approach to managing the epidemic.

The first trial to assess whether preventive treatment with HIV drugs could affect rates of infection in people who inject drugs has found that daily tablets of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir), an anti-retroviral drug, reduced HIV incidence by nearly half (48.9%) compared to a placebo , according to results published in the medical journal The Lancet.A team of researchers led by Kachit Choopanya and Michael Martin , chief of clinical research for Thailand's ministry of public health, recruited over 2,400 participants at 17 drug treatment clinics in Thailand.

The court said it was ""absurd'' for him to say it was in the interest of his wife to go in for early detection.Justice Roshan Dalvi heard a petition by Santa Cruz resident Joel D'Souza (name changed), who met Joan (name changed) through a marriage bureau. Both professionals, they married on December 26, 2009. In June 2010, Joan had typhoid and went to her mother's place nearby. Thereafter, Joel stopped calling or receiving her calls. On July 7, 2010, he took her call but told her he would not take her back, without explanation. The medical test report of July 7, 2010 confirmed Joan was cured of typhoid and tests included for HIV antibodies.On July 10, 2010, on reaching her matrimonial home, she found Joel had changed the lock. On October 22, 2010, he filed for divorce alleging impotency/non-consummation of marriage and cruelty. Pending the petition, on March 16, 2011 Joel filed an application praying for direction to Joan to undergo HIV, TB and hepatitis tests along with tests for impotency/failure to consummate the marriage as he suspected she was HIV positive.In his application before the FC, Joel gave many reasons, including fever, tiredness, body ache, dry cough, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and headache. He said Joan had a bloated abdomen although her face, hands and legs were very thin and due to this she wore long outfits. ""On an official website of HIV, it is documented that HIV is medically caused due to accumulation of fat in the stomach,'' he stated. He said she spoke in her sleep using the words 'HIV' and 'AIDS' and mentioned 'Jack Dorsan', who he found on the Internet was in the prostitution business. He said his wife had stored Dorsan's telephone number and spoke to him on the day of their wedding.He said she applied lip balm five to six times a day ""as the best treatment for Herpes Simplex Virus is keeping the lips moist"". Joan said Joel's suspicion was ""reckless, wild and cruel'' and he himself needed treatment.The FC on May 16, 2012 rejected his application with costs saying, however strong his suspicion, he had to prove the allegations by furnishing evidence so that the court can grant him relief. Joel moved the high court in October 2012.Joan's advocate Mini Mathew argued that the July 7, 2010 report confirming she was cured of typhoid was sufficient to hold that it was not necessary to send her for an HIV test. She said Joel had been spreading rumours about her. ""These allegations are stigmatizing. Her reputation is ruined,'' she said.Joel's advocate Uday Warunjikar said, ""He caught his wife taking HIV medicines. If she is not suffering from HIV, why is she afraid of the test?'' he asked.

""The project taught me to speak for myself and stand up for my rights,"" says Asha.Funded through European Union and Christian Aid, the project aims to contribute to the National Aids Control Programme—III's overall goal of halting and reversing the HIV epidemic in India. This was to be achieved by providing non–stigmatized PPTCT services through networks and volunteers.According to Asha, before the PPTCT project, women were neither able to access government health services nor opted for hospital deliveries. After the programme began, there has been a definite increase in both accessing services and hospital deliveries. ""More importantly there has been a drop in the number of children that are born HIV positive,"" says Asha, who shared her experiences at a round table meeting in the capital on Tuesday.District government doctors give lists of HIV positive people to PPTCT volunteers to follow-up.

She used to send ration to the kids and they cooked their own meals,"" says a neighbour.They were attending a school in Sabarmati for free. While the school authorities did not oppose their HIV tag, when the word spread, other kids started maintaining a distance and soon after, they stopped attending school.A number of organizations initially extended a helping hand but the siblings soon realized that they were essentially all alone in this world. Purnima Gupta, assistant director, Childline , told TOI that the organization came to know about the kids a year back when they had already become world-weary. ""Pratik was sent to a hostel for HIV kids at Gandhinagar a year back but he could not settle there and returned home. The teen saw his sister die in May this year and is aware of his eventuality.

However, the words seem totally meaningless in the world where people discriminate HIV positive people , even in hospitals

The trouble for HIV infected Ram (name changed), about whom TOI reported a week ago, were seemingly endless. There was discrimination in getting medical aid at Shiv Prasad Gupta (SPG) divisional hospital. Now, the fate of another HIV patient Vishal (name changed) who, incidentally, has been admitted in the adjacent bed, is also the same. Both these patients lay neglected in ward number 2 of divisional hospital. The lack of awareness about the disease has made the hospital staff reluctant to attend these patients.When TOI reported about the discrimination against Ram in the hospital, the chief medical officer (CMO), Dr MP Chaurasia and district magistrate, Pranjal Yadav and the hospital authorities assured to give proper treatment to him. However, six days later, Ram is still in the similar situation. So is the case with Vishal.Both patients are suffering from severe gangrene infection in their legs and hands and have the history of intravenous drug addiction. Since both are HIV infected. But the paramedical staff of the hospital has refused to attend them.""They do not even touch me, forget bandaging the wounds. My mother gets the cotton and bandage from the nurses and apply it on my leg, she is uneducated and knows nothing about medicines. I feel helpless. I want to die,'' said Ram, his eyes welling up.According to Vishal, his dressing has not been done from the past one week. He gets his dressing done from a private clinic situated outside the hospital after paying Rs 50 every day.The two cannot go to any other hospital for their treatment because both of them come from very weak economic background.The case of these HIV positive patients has only raised question over the implementation of NACO guidelines that clearly says that HIV AIDS patients are to be treated at par with the general patients.There should be no discrimination, the guideline say.

It has been found that the risk of transmission involved is minimal, just 2%, when the mother is on ARV using a combination drug regime,"" said Dr Jayachandra Reddy, joint director, basic services, AP State Aids Control Society (APSACS).""The child is given nevirapine syrup for six weeks and then septran syrup till the 18th month in case early infant diagnosis or DNA PCR test shows that the child is HIV-negative. In case the child is found to be HIV positive, he or she is put on ARV. WHO ( World Health Organisation ) recommends alternative or replacement bottle feeding only if five factors are satisfied. These include AFASS - Affordability, Feasibility, Acceptability, Safety and Sustainability,"" said the APSACS official.While breast-feeding is recommended for all newborns, there has been controversy over HIV positive mothers breastfeeding their babies but this has now been dispelled with the WHO and doctors dealing with AIDS recommending breastfeeding by HIV positive mothers who are on ARV even in developing countries.According to Dr K Surya Rao, specialist in HIV/AIDS medicine from Dr Kutikuppala Hospital, one has to weigh the risk and benefits while breastfeeding. ""In India, as per WHO, annually, nearly two-thirds of the over 2.4 million child deaths are related to inappropriate infant feeding practices. Due to lack of breast milk, many infants die of diarrhoea and gastroenteritis overnight. Even though there's some risk of vertical transmission involved, there are ways to prevent it too.""""The mother should be on highly active ARV right from pregnancy, depending on her viral load and take a combination of drugs instead of the earlier practiced mono-therapy. The mother should also be comfortable feeding the child as per requirement. Also, a campaign needs to be undertaken, especially in rural and tribal areas regarding non-discarding the colostrum, which is a component in the mother's first milk containing high protein and antibody and boosts the immune system,"" Dr Rao explained.Concurring with experts, Dr Ronanki Ramesh, additional district medical and health officer (AIDS and leprosy) said, ""Mixed feeding with breast and bottle-milk should be avoided to cut down the risk of transmission. Also, in poor or developing countries, women may not have access to safe and affordable replacement feeding options and handling of milk bottles isn't hygienic and triggers more diarrhoea deaths in infants. Therefore, irrespective of the HIV status, mothers on ARV are encouraged to breastfeed their children within one hour of birth.""According to doctors, breastfeeding is the best way to provide ideal food for the healthy growth and development of infants as apart from creating immunity and protecting the baby from infections, it also creates a special bond between the mother and child.","['hiv', 'positive', 'mothers', 'mother', 'child', 'transmission', 'arv', 'feeding', 'dr', 'breastfeed', 'breastfeeding']","VISAKHAPATNAM: HIV positive mothers can breastfeed their newborns provided they are on anti-retroviral therapy (ARV) right through the pregnancy, the delivery and post-delivery period, including the breast-feeding period, to prevent vertical transmission of HIV from mother to child, say medical experts on the occasion of the World Breastfeeding Week that is being celebrated from August 1 to 7 to encourage breastfeeding.According to experts, the HIV positive mothers should exclusively breastfeed their children irrespective of HIV status for the first six months while non-infected mothers can breastfeed till the child reaches two years of age.

among blood banks and hasty oversight on the part of the recipient.

AndhramalpracticesAs per the data available on the occurrence of such cases between 2009 and 2012, in different states across the country, mentioned in the Parliament recently, the number of people infected with HIV through blood transfusions in Andhra Pradesh was allegedly amongst the highest in India. In the recent past, instances of transfusion of HIV-infected blood were widely reported from Nellore and Warangal.Amongst the southern states, Tamil Nadu did not report any case, while Karnataka recorded 100 such cases more than AP during the same period. Activists working with the people with HIV say the high numbers can be attributed to the demand-supply gap for safe blood. Voluntary blood donations rates are not high while blood banks peddle infected blood, they said. The failure of the government to rein in such malpractices only makes matters worse.In May, this year, an 18-month-old baby Kavya, was detected with HIV AIDS, which doctors suspect occurred from an infected blood transfusion. The news made national headlines, highlighting negligence on the part of authorities.Narendra Revelli of Centre for Advocacy and Research who has been working for a decade with the AP State Aids Control Society (APSACS) blames private blood banks. ""It is mandatory to check blood for HIV before it is banked. However, owing to the supply shortage, unauthorized blood banks do not discard infected blood even if it tests HIV-positive. There is no possibility of infection if blood is checked and banked properly,"" he said.Revelli said that banks mostly rely heavily on professional donors who donate blood for money and therefore do it on a weekly basis. ""There are several such donors near the clock tower area in Secunderabad and Nampally where there are many private blood banks,"" he added.Officials of APSACS, however, disputed the numbers stating that blood transfusion is the cause of infection in very few cases. Nevertheless, they did not rule out risks of contracting the virus from blood available at unauthorized blood banks. ""The number of cases in which blood transfusion has been established as the cause for infection is much less. However, it should be noted that there is a risk of infection if blood is procured from unauthorized blood banks where testing for HIV may not be performed,"" said Dr J C Reddy of Integrated Counselling and Testing Services (ICTS) wing at APSACS.The figures quoted in the Parliament are those from ICTSs across the country. Experts also said that the district and state health officials do not supervise blood banks.

The five-year-long study, conducted by the Pune-based National AIDS Research Institute NARI ) along with HIV Neurobehavioral Research Programme at the University of California, San Diego, found that people with HIV/ AIDS in India are at higher risk of developing milder neuro-cognitive impairment if treatment is not initiated. The study was completed in May this year.The study has indicated a higher baseline prevalence (47%) of neuro-cognitive impairment in people with advanced HIV infection who are yet to take treatment. Neurocognitive impairment affects cognition (thinking), motor control (body movements) and the psychological state of the individual.The world over, people with HIV infection are living longer and having a better quality of life due to greater access to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Thanks to ART, HIV induced illnesses like cryptococal meningitis have been on the decline. However, conditions like HIV-associated neuro-cognitive disorder (HAND) are still prevalent.The study also assumes significance as earlier studies in the western world were based on the subtype B virus that causes HIV infection. However, in India, clade C is the most common subtype. Based on its characteristics, clade C has been found to affect an individual’s nervous system less severely than other subtypes. It was milder than the subtype B prevalent in Europe and America, researchers say.“The baseline finding of the study suggests that clinicians and healthcare providers must know if people living with HIV have any difficulties with cognition or performing daily activities. The family members or the caregivers should also be told of such conditions so that they can detect changes in the individual and seek timely advice from healthcare providers,” researcher Manisha Ghate, co-principal investigator of the study, told TOI on Thursday.Ghate said, “The routine activities of HIV-infected people may get affected if they have neuro-cognitive impairment. In milder forms, it may be prominent only while performing complex tasks like calculations and multitasking. But it is pronounced in severe forms like dementia and patients may have difficulty even in performing routine daily activities like cooking, bathing and walking. Cognitive impairment associated with HIV has been correlated with the increased complaints of job performance difficulties and poor medication adherence.”Researcher Sanjay Mehendale, the principal investigator of the study, said, “The beneficial effect of ART has been observed in cognitively impaired individuals. The improvement was seen in the domains of learning, executive functioning and motor performance. This beneficial effect was also observed in cognitively impaired individuals with higher CD4 counts.”Even otherwise, healthy people show neurological decline as they age. “But here we have a younger population infected with HIV, so this effect will be greater as they age. Patients need counselling in addition to ART,” Ghate said.When contacted, NARI director Ramesh Paranjape said, “This is the first comprehensive study in India which has additionally evaluated viral and host factors associated with neuro-cognitive impairments in people with HIV.”People with HIV infection are living longer and better due to improved access to antiretroviral therapy. Though neurological opportunistic infections are on decline, non opportunistic conditions like HIV associated neurocognitive impairment (HAND) remain prevalent. It has been shown that the impaired cognitive performance can affect routine activities, employment, adherence to treatment and quality of life.

After allegedly waiting for about a week for admission, the 24-year-old was finally taken away by the community members on Tuesday. Last heard, she was on her way to a place in Bihar for 'treatment' by quacks.Heena's fault was that she got castrated in February this year somewhere in Bihar by 'professionals' in the community. Heena was also detected to be HIV-positive about a couple of months back. With no encouragement from the community to go to a hospital, Heena was treated by quacks for a few weeks. But when her condition deteriorated, she sought the help of Association of Trangenders and Hijras in Bengal (ATHB).After running from one official to another at SSKM, Heena was asked to come to the hospital on September 9. She was checked by doctors of the urology department on September 9 and advised admission. But the hospital authority said since Heena had undergone castration, she needed an order from a district judge for admission.""We had no knowledge of this formality. They kept insisting that we get this order from a district judge. How could the patient get it when she herself was unable to move because of the ailment? We were worried about her condition,"" said ATHB secretary Ranjita Sinha.Heena's cries of pain fell on deaf ears as the hospital allegedly kept citing the legal issues. Aggravating the problem was the absence of a separate ward for the third sex. Even as some doctors were sympathetic, they too pleaded helplessness. The hospital also told them that a relative had to sign a risk bond in case admission was granted. Since Heena has no family, her 'hirja gurus' were convinced by ATHB to sign the bond. Accordingly, some from the community came to the hospital. But seeing the delay and the apathy, they took Heena away and she left for Bihar on Wednesday morning.In the meantime, ATHB members sought the intervention of the West Bengal State AIDs Prevention and Control Society (WBSAPCS). While some officials claimed that they were talking to hospital authorities; some pleaded that they were out of station.""Some people from the eunuch community who had come to the hospital were getting impatient. They were pained by the way Heena was suffering. They lamented that they had no place in the society, even in hospitals.

AIDS is the result.""We hypothesised that an important role of the fusion machinery is to open the viral membrane when triggered, and it follows that a trigger didn't necessarily have to be a doomed cell,"" Abrams said.""So we envisioned particular ways the components of the viral fusion machinery work and designed a molecule that would trigger it prematurely,"" Abrams said.The team designed DAVEI from two main ingredients. One piece, called the Membrane Proximal External Region (MPER), is itself a small piece of the fusion machinery and interacts strongly with viral membranes.The other piece, called cyanovirin, binds to the sugar coating of the protein spike.

But, thanks to the exclusive legal aid centre at ART centre in Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH). The centre has so far dealt with 137 cases related to injustice done to patients infected with HIV, who are mostly women.Since its inauguration in April 2010, the legal aid centre has so far handled 153 cases including 78 male and 75 female cases related to various types of discrimination against people infected with HIV. Around 137 cases have been solved outside the court. For instance, a 33-year-old man from Palakkarai in Trichy , who was tested HIV positive after his marriage to a 24-year-old woman in Pudukkottai, died in January 2012. Since her husband succumbed to HIV, the family of her husband harassed her in order to chase her away from them.Moreover, they denied her a share in their property. The woman was brought to the legal aid centre a few months after her husband's death. The advocate and the counsellor counselled the family members of her husband and explained them about the legal consequences they would face if she was denied of her rights. Only then his family agreed to give her share. Initially they disagreed to give her the share as they were under the impression that their son was infected with HIV because of his wife. But the fact was that she was infected with HIV by her husband. ""We are successfully dealing with the case and trying to get justice.

The treatment of patients with HIV has been revolutionized by the advent of combination anti-retroviral drugs.However, although these drugs are highly effective at keeping HIV at bay, they must be taken for the life of the patient and never eliminate the infection completely . This is illustrated by the often rapid resurgence of virus in patients who stop taking these medications.The persistence of HIV is partially due to the ability of the virus to disable the cell's altruistic suicide pathway, which is normally activated when a cell becomes infected or damaged.A team of researchers led by Michael Mathews and Hartmut Hanauske-Abel, previously showed that Ciclopirox, commonly used by dermatologists and gynaecologists to treat fungal infections, inhibits the expression of HIV genes in culture. The drug works inhibits the expression of HIV genes and also blocks the essential function of the mitochondria, thereby reactivating the cell’s suicide pathway.Healthy, uninfected cells examined during this study were spared.

The new findings of the AIDS-causing virus's complex envelope, includes sites that future vaccines will try to mimic to elicit a protective immune response.

Scientists at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) and Weill Cornell Medical College determined the first atomic-level structure of the tripartite HIV envelope protein?long considered one of the most difficult targets in structural biology and of great value for medical science.

""Most of the prior structural studies of this envelope complex focused on individual subunits; but we've needed the structure of the full complex to properly define the sites of vulnerability that could be targeted, for example with a vaccine,"" said Ian A Wilson, a senior author of the study.

HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus, currently infects about 34 million people globally, 10 per cent of whom are children, according to World Health Organisation estimates.

Although antiviral drugs are now used to manage many HIV infections, especially in developed countries, scientists have long sought a vaccine that can prevent new infections and perhaps ultimately eradicate the virus from the human population.

However, none of the HIV vaccines tested so far has come close to providing adequate protection. This failure is due largely to the challenges posed by HIV's envelope protein, known to virologists as Env.

Env's structure is so complex and delicate that scientists have had great difficulty obtaining the protein in a form that is suitable for the atomic-resolution imaging necessary to understand it.

""It tends to fall apart, for example, even when it?s on the surface of the virus, so to study it we have to engineer it to be more stable,"" said biologist Andrew Ward.

The research team was able to engineer a version of the Env trimer (three-component structure) that has the stability and other properties needed for atomic-resolution imaging, yet retains virtually all the structures found on native Env.

Using cutting-edge imaging methods, electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, the team was able to look at the new Env trimer.

The X-ray crystallography study was the first ever of an Env trimer, and both methods resolved the trimer structure to a finer level of detail than has been reported before.

The data illuminated the complex process by which the Env trimer assembles and later undergoes radical shape changes during infection and clarified how it compares to envelope proteins on other dangerous viruses, such as flu and Ebola.

The findings are published in the journal Science Express.","['hiv', 'vaccine', 'complex', 'unlock', 'env', 'virus', 'protein', 'scientists', 'structure', 'envelope', 'trimer', 'clues']","WASHINGTON: In a breakthrough, scientists have mapped the most detailed images yet of the protein responsible for getting HIV into cells, paving way for a potential vaccine for AIDS.

The study was necessitated as several ethical issues and challenges started emerging, especially in terms of the standard of care of HIV/AIDS patients, due to the increasing commercialisation of the medical profession, the doctor stated.The study sought the opinion of the patients on parameters and ethical issues such as principles of autonomy, paternalism or dictatorship, dignity of individual, informed consent, right to refuse treatment, principles of confidentiality, patient's right to know about his treatment and also role of surrogates (family or relatives).Of the 1,800 HIV positive patients, 1,450 fully participated in the study between March 2011 and February 2013 and are under treatment at KKSR Hospital and Research Centre , Visakhapatnam. After getting complete responses from 1,450 patients, the study found that 65.6% of the patients faced paternalism or authoritarian behaviour from doctors, 55.2% felt they were not treated in a dignified manner, 75.8% patients faced lack of autonomy, informed consent (that is explaining the pros and cons of treatment and contraindications to patients) was not taken from 55.1% patients, 87.2% patients had no choice to refuse treatment, principle of confidentiality about treatment and HIV status was maintained only in 48.2% cases. Further, just 24.1% of patients said they were informed about their treatment procedures and in 86.2% cases, it's the patients' relatives or guardians who spoke to the doctor on behalf of the patients without giving the patients a chance to speak up about their problems.""Overall, it was felt that the United Nations Organisation and World Health Organisation should formulate and implement new ethical guidelines in the treatment and care of HIV/AIDS patients in the background of severe stigma attached to HIV/AIDS,"" stated Dr Rao.Referring to the key points of the study, professor of psychiatry and superintendent of Government Hospital for Mental Health , Vizag, Dr N N Raju, pointed out that HIV-AIDS is one ailment that is associated with a lot of stigma and different socio-psychological aspects are involved, especially in India. ""Many a time, we come across family members who request the treating doctors not to reveal the HIV status to the patient as they fear the patient would get depressed or turn suicidal if they learn the truth. In such cases, getting informed consent becomes difficult.""""Moreover, in India, the doctor-patient ratio is disproportionate and one doctor sometimes has to see around 100 patients a day, which makes giving a patient hearing to each case difficult. More social workers and trained counsellors are required to generate awareness. With effective treatment regime available, HIV, like TB, can be controlled to a great extent and so the stigma needs to be dispelled gradually as has happened in the case of TB in last few decades,"" stated the doctor.","['hivaids', 'issues', 'hiv', 'informed', 'study', 'doctor', 'patients', 'poses', 'sociopsychological', 'ethical', 'stigma', 'cases', 'treatment']","Further, just 24.1% of patients said they were informed about their treatment procedures and in 86.2% cases, it's the patients' relatives or guardians who spoke to the doctor on behalf of the patients without giving the patients a chance to speak up about their problems.

It has been confirmed earlier that if a person becomes infected with two different strains, they can fuse and a recombined form can occur.The new strain found to be the most dangerous has been found in Guinea-Bissau The period from infection to development of AIDS was the shortest reported among HIV-1 types, at around five years.“Recombinants seem to be more vigorous and more aggressive than the strains from which they developed. The recombinant studied is called A3/02 and is a cross between the two most common strains in Guinea-Bissau, 02AG and A3,” said Angelica Palm from Lund University.So far the new strain has only been identified in West Africa, but other studies have shown that the global spread of different recombinants is increasing.“In countries and regions with high levels of immigration, such as the US and Europe, the trend is towards an increasingly mixed and complex HIV flora, unlike in the beginning of the epidemic when a small number of non-recombinant variants of the virus dominated. There is, therefore, reason to be wary of HIV recombinants in general,” Palm added.The virus strain was first reported by Joakim Esbjornsson from the University of Oxford, who is the co-author of the study.An estimated 4.9 million people were living with HIV in Asia-Pacific in 2012. Twelve countries account for more than 90% of people living with HIV and of new HIV infections in the region which includes India, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.Emerging epidemics are becoming evident: between 2001 and 2012, new HIV infections increased 2.6 times in Indonesia, Pakistan has seen an eight-fold increase and new infections in the Philippines have more than doubled.“HIV is an extremely dynamic and variable virus. New subtypes and recombinant forms of HIV-1 have been introduced to our part of the world, and it is highly likely that there are a large number of circulating recombinants of which we know little or nothing.

We had married against our families’ wishes. We knew he would have no one if we died,” said the 42-year-old, who was infected in 2001. “My husband died in 2004. My resolve to live only grew stronger after that. I did odd jobs to fund my son’s education. Many people turned me away when they got to know I had AIDS,” said Hema, who had a near death experience in 2006.The gathered people rued that despite awareness campaigns by the government, HIV infected and affected people have a tough time getting a job. “It is sad that they are still identified as patients who have a dreaded disease. While many are waking up to the fact that HIV can’t be transmitted through sharing a glass, the awareness hasn’t gone to the extent of employing infected people. While anti-retroviral drugs has helped manage the disease, we still need to come up with a tool to help them fight stigma,” said S Noori, president of South India Positive Network.Doctors at the hospital said the antiretroviral therapy (ART) over the last decade has helped save a lot of HIV infected people.

Earlier this year, the private firm forced him to resign with a monetary compensation. Adding to his woes, a legislation that promises to punish such discrimination has been in the works for several years now.The HIV/AIDS Bill was drafted in 2006, but is being shunted between the health and law ministries. Activists, lawyers and people living with HIV have been fighting for the Bill to be introduced during the winter session of Parliament. Rallies are planned across the country to highlight the issue on Sunday, World AIDS Day.

After a person is tested positive, the ART medication starts at the earliest. Jagdish Patil , the regional programme officer of the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS), told TOI, ""We are targeting those in the high-risk groups such as male and female sex workers, and trans genders, who are most vulnerable, to spread the awareness about the syndrome. As this group is brought under control, the spread of the virus to the secondary population, such as spouses and children of these people, also decreases. We have brought around 90% infected people to ART centres to provide medication which has significantly reduced the spread.""The District AIDS Prevention Control Unit (DAPCU), along with the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO), is going to conduct a survey among those engaged in cutting of sugarcane for HIV infection. ""The sugar cutters are mostly migratory workers and considered the bridge-population for the virus to spread. However, there is no study about how much these people contribute to the spread of virus. However, the population has the potential risk of transmitting the virus through unsafe sex,"" Patil added.Along with the decline in the AIDS cases among the general masses, the district has also recorded a dip in in the parent-to-child transmission of the virus. ""Last year, about 67 children were infected through their HIV -positive mother. This year, the number has been significantly declined because of te co-ordinating efforts of private and public anti-natal care centres. A single-dose regimen of Nevirapin has reduced the transmission rate from 30% to 11%. We will start the triple drug regimen that can bring down the rate further to 2-5%,"" Patil said.","['hiv', 'aids', 'virus', 'infected', 'trend', 'transmission', 'shows', 'centres', 'declining', 'spread', 'control', 'patil', 'district', 'infection']","KOLHAPUR: The district has in the past year registered a noticeable decline in cases of HIV infection, including parent-to -child transmission.

Despite this, Nidhi Patel (24) married him recently. It was a love marriage and Nidhi says her love is blind , but positively.In fact, when Vimal spoke about his marriage with a physician, he was told to avoid tying the knot. The doctor advised lying about his HIV status would be unethical and unjust to the girl. He was surprised to know that Nidhi, who knew Vimal for three years, was aware of his disease but determined to marry the Ahmedabad-based sales executive.“I refused to believe my patient and asked him to bring his girlfriend along for counseling. I thought the girl was probably blinded by love and did not know the seriousness of the disease,’’ said infectious diseases specialist Dr Atul Patel. “I was surprised to meet the girl who was aware of the challenges of living with an HIV infected person. In fact, she was adamant that she would not let HIV be an obstacle to her love.’’The marriage is a personal victory of love. But it reflects changing attitudes related to HIV patients as well. Experts say a decade ago, they would have to grapple with not only the physical and mental fallouts of the dreaded infection but also emotional manifestations of the being abandoned out of fear. At least two of every 10 patients would be divorced and many disowned by their families.“The current social scenario for HIV patients is far more positive. Not only do we see a lot of HIV positive patients marrying each other, we are also seeing boys and girls with no infection willingly marrying HIV positive people. This trend signifies a greater acceptance of HIV in society and the fact that HIV is not a death sentence. It is a disease which can be managed with good treatment and care,” said Dr Patel.Sunita, 28, is another person, who married her boyfriend of two years, despite knowing he is HIV positive. In fact, Sunita’s mother consulted a physician with her to dissuade her. But she prevailed saying she would like to find out how she could live happily with an HIV positive person. She also got married recently.* An HIV discordant couple is where one spouse is HIV negative.* In such cases, infectious diseases experts say safe sex should be practiced. If the viral load is non-traceable in a blood test, the couple can try for a baby during the fertile period* At least two international studies reveal that if the person is on proper HIV medication and the HIV load is untraceable in blood tests, the HIV infection is not spread through sex and other contact* When the discordant couple is trying for a baby using unprotected sex, prophylactic anti-viral treatment can be given to the negative spouse","['hiv', 'positive', 'triumphs', 'fact', 'patel', 'patients', 'sex', 'person', 'nidhi', 'vimal', 'love']","AHMEDABAD: Vimal Patel (26) has been HIV positive for 10 years.

According to the officials, around 250 HIV positive deliveries take place in Vizag district every year.As per the PPCT treatment, HIV testing is conducted on all pregnant women and if found positive, anti-retroviral treatment (ART) is administered from the 14th week of pregnancy, irrespective of the CD4 count. Right after birth, Nevirapine and Septran syrup are given to the baby. Blood tests (DBS-PCR tests) are also done from time to time till the child is one-and-half-years old. If the child tests HIV negative, then he or she can be said to be free from HIV transmission. Breastfeeding is also encouraged since the mother is kept on ART drugs.Additional district medical and health officer (AIDS and leprosy) Dr Ronanki Ramesh said, ""Currently, around 8,000 HIV positive pregnant women are undergoing ART in Vizag as per the government records. We are focusing on zero vertical transmission of the virus from the mother to the newborn and therefore implementing PPCT in every possible antenatal case. This advanced drug regime was introduced on September 2012 as a pilot project in AP and Karnataka and now the success rate is almost 98%. We will soon conduct sensitization workshops for private gynaecologists so that PPCT is followed in every case.""Besides a decrease in vertical transmission in antenatal cases, focus is given on bringing down HIV-TB co-infections.

A UNICEF report says that AIDS-related deaths amongst adolescents between the ages of 10 and 19 increased by 50% between 2005 and 2012, rising from 71,000 to 110,000 and that many adolescents were unaware that they were infected.The 2013 Stocktaking Report on Children and AIDS—released on the occasion of World AIDS on Sunday-- says that an estimated 74% of the 2.1 million adolescents live in 12 high burden countries. It says that investments to the tune of USD 5.5 billion by next year will be required to avoid an added two million adolescents, particularly girls, becoming infected by 2020. Investments in 2010 were US$3.8 billion.“If high-impact interventions are scaled up using an integrated approach, we can halve the number of new infections among adolescents by 2020,” said UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake. “It’s a matter of reaching the most vulnerable adolescents with effective programmes – urgently.”The report also found that girls are more vulnerable among adolescents. Of the total of 2.1 million individuals, 1.2 million are females. The total infected adolescent population in South Asia is 130,000 with 51% men and 49% women. Much more attention is needed to prevent and treat HIV during adolescence, so that children remain AIDS-free in the second decade of life. New infections among adolescents could be halved by 2020 by scaling up high-impact interventions and working across sectors. The treatment, care and support needs of children living with HIV change as they grow older and begin to take greater responsibility for their own health. But services generally do not keep pace with or cater to their needs. This is particularly true for marginalized adolescents males who have sex with males, adolescents who inject drugs and sexually exploited adolescents despite the disproportionately high prevalence of HIV among them.Experts have advised a combination of high-impact interventions including condoms, antiretroviral treatment, prevention of mother-to-child transmission, voluntary medical male circumcision, communications for behaviour change, and targeted approaches for at-risk and marginalized populations. This is in addition to investments in other sectors such as education, social protection and welfare, and strengthening health systems.","['21', 'hiv', 'children', 'adolescents', '12', 'million', 'high', 'nations', 'highimpact', 'report', 'investments', 'india', 'interventions']","NEW DELHI: A new report puts India among 12 high burden countries like South Africa, Nigeria and Tanzania that are home to the 2.1 million adolescents living with HIV in 2012.

She fills up the room when she hurries in. “I can’t hear,” she says, motioning to her hearing aid. Her eardrums were damaged in a car accident when she was three.But her hardest struggle has been to fight the stigma that came with the HIV virus she contracted eight years ago due to medical negligence.The three abortions she underwent between 2004 and 2006 (“Oral contraceptive made me nauseous and my ex-husband didn’t care for condoms”) did her in. The homemaker, blogger and HIV activist believes infected surgical implements may have been used. “Poz? Me? Not possible. There has to be a mistake,” she writes on her blog, recounting receiving the test results when she went in for her fourth abortion. That she had destroyed records of all three previous surgeries meant she couldn’t hold anyone accountable. “The nursing home staff suggested I have the baby because it was my last chance due to the complications the serial abortions had led to.”Until then, Dhawale admits, she knew nothing about the Human Immunodeficiency Virus which triggers the progressive failure of the immune system, allowing life-threatening infections to thrive. “I thought it only happened to those with multiple partners. I didn’t have them, neither did my husband.” The Vasai clinic she delivered her baby at (he is seven years old now), administered Zidovudine, an antiretroviral drug, to prevent transmission of virus from mother to child. Her marriage ended in 2007 — “due to incompatibility, not the infection”, she clarifies — making her isolation complete. The counselling centre run by Kripa Foundation that she was directed to was ill equipped to empower patients with accurate information about medicine dosage, side effects or the nature of the virus.She realised she had to know more. The online information space was one she chose to dip into between 2010 and 2011, sparking off her transformation. Dhawale learnt that virus transmission didn’t stand a chance if partners stayed healthy and the infected person kept the virus count low with medication.“In India, abstinence is the only solution experts offer,” she says, recounting how an ‘AIDS specialist’ she visited in 2012 advised Surve, who was then her boyfriend, against kissing her. “He even suggested we wear gloves while being intimate. Even if traces of the virus exist in the saliva , it cannot be transmitted unless one or both partners have bleeding gums or open sores. It’s the same during oral sex unless one partner suffers from an STD or the viral load is at a detectable level,” she clarifies.In fact, it was during her time online that she met Surve. The two hit it off, and eventually she told him she was HIV+ve. “He disappeared for three months,” she giggles.“I was shocked,” he says. “But not a single day went by when I did not think of her.”Surve, who Dhawale says on her blog, had dilly dallied for two-anda-half years, offered a commitment this August when she was ironically preparing to participate at an HIV matrimonial meet in Pune. Expectedly, there was resistance from Surve’s family. After all, she had a ‘sex worker’s’ disease. “We tell people on a need-to-know basis, and educate them on how it’s transmitted,” says Surve, who admits that it’s family and close friends who are aware that they are a serodiscordent couple.That Dhawale never let the virus rob her vivacity has made sure the couple enjoy a “rocking, fearless but protected sex life”. “There are procedures to follow in case of a condom tear, pills you can take within 72 hours of the act, under the doctor’s guidance,” explains Surve.Their constant effort is to keep the virus load down, reducing any chance of transmission. The medicines that Dhawale takes twice a day at times so precise, the couple set an alarm for it, are personalised based on her lifestyle, and blood, liver parameters. “If you miss a dose, the virus will multiply. If you overdose, the hormones go for a toss,” he says.Does the fear of untimely death hang over the couple? “With proper exercise, diet and medication,” he says, “an HIV+ve person can outlive an HIV-ve one. We are making sure Jyoti does.”Always use a condom. Have your partner tested for HIV before engaging in a physical relationship and/or marriage. Insist that labs, clinics and hospitals use disposable syringes and screens.","['positive', 'hiv', 'surve', 'dhawale', 'sex', 'staying', 'virus', 'transmission', 'hivve', 'didnt', 'finding', 'partners', 'love', 'jyoti']","The homemaker, blogger and HIV activist believes infected surgical implements may have been used.

International consultant on HIV/AIDS from Pune Dr Vinay Kulkarni, noted physician from the city Dr Milind Bhurshundi, associate professor at IGGMC Dr Kshama Kedar and Manish Mudliar from SAATHI ( Solidarity and Action Against The HIV Infection in India) were the faculties.""Since the new regimen will come into practice soon, we wanted our members to know about the changes in treatment modalities,"" said IMA, Nagpur president Dr Warsha Dhawale. Explaining the new regimen and the reason for introducing it, Dr Kedar who is also the chairperson of IMA's HIV committee said, ""For preventing the transmission of virus from mother to child, we give the mother only one drug. Resistance has developed against this drug in the virus, so we will start administering three drugs to pregnant positive women.""Primary prevention measure must be to avoid unwanted pregnancy and monitor a planned one in an HIV positive woman, said Dr Kulkarni. ""Once infected, it is important to link them to proper care and treatment. The new programme seems much more efficient than the previous one. Its success, however, would depend on the extent of patients covered. The most important thing is to screen all pregnant women for HIV and link all patients to proper facilities,"" he said.Along with this, stress must be given on adolescent counselling to prevent new cases of the disease as India is among the top 12 countries as far as load of HIV-positive adolescents are concerned, said Dr Kedar. Agreed Dr Bhurshundi and added, ""Though the prevalence of HIV is decreasing, there is another alarming trend to be concerned about. Most people affected by the disease are in the 18-24 age group and yet there is not much research or stress on these patients.""He also warned that affected people should lay clear off quacks who claim that they can be rid of the virus. ""Instead of being stringent about one's drug schedule and following doctors' instructions can improve one's quality of life tremendously,"" said Dr Bhurshundi.THE NEW REGIMENInstead of a single drug to patient when she is in labour, a triple drug regimen to be usedThis will help in countering the resistance developing in the virus so as to suppress viral load during birthEarlier, patients with CD4 below 250 were put on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Now the limit has been raised to 350Provision for ART for all children with HIV under 5 years of age, all pregnant and breastfeeding women with HIV, and to all HIV-positive couples where one partner is uninfected, irrespective of CD4 count","['hiv', 'pregnant', 'patients', 'regimen', 'triple', 'virus', 'bring', 'world', 'women', 'dr', 'drug', 'cases', 'kedar']","NAGPUR: The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared its intention to bring down the number of new cases of HIV/AIDS to zero by the year 2015.

""The number is quite alarming. But there's no way to prove that the virus has been transmitted through patients during surgeries or treatment even though the risk of contracting HIV is very high in government hospitals. Also, due to the stigma involved, the actual statistics never come out,"" the doctor informs.While private hospital doctors can choose to turn away patients who refuse to undergo HIV test prior to surgeries, there's no such option for doctors working in government hospitals. Legally, a patient can't be forced to undergo the HIV test. For operating on such patients, the medical team needs special protective and disposable gear, which may or may not be available always at state-run hospitals, exposing doctors and others in the operation theatre to the risk of contracting the deadly HIV virus. Taking elaborate safety precautions for all surgical cases is also not economically feasible, point out medical experts.Dr P V Sudhakar, head of the department of plastic surgery and deputy superintendent of King George Hospital (KGH), informs, ""Unlike private hospitals, we can't turn away a vulnerable patient who refuses to undertake HIV test prior to a surgery. So the entire surgical team needs to be alerted about the HIV status of the patient and accordingly, the doctors, medicos and other healthcare personnel associated with the surgery need to take special precautions, wear disposable synthetic gowns and double gloves but often government hospitals run out of special gears and HIV kits. Taking universal precautions for each and every case, assuming all of them to be HIV positive or Hepatitis B positive cases, may not be economically feasible.""The lack of gloves sometimes forces junior doctors or medicos to draw blood samples barehanded, a situation that clearly is alarming for them. Says a junior doctor from the hospital, ""After drawing blood samples barehanded due to the shortage of gloves, we do rush to take post-exposure prophylaxis. But this too is not recommended nor possible every time as these could be toxic drugs. There needs to be continuous supply of special gears and kits for dealing with HIV patients. The only other option for us is to purchase the disposable gloves from our pocket each time we assist in surgeries or draw blood.""When queried, Dr Jayachandra Reddy, joint director, basic services, Andhra Pradesh State AIDS Control Society (APSACS) remarked, ""Indiscriminate HIV testing is not required prior to surgery for all patients. Naco ( National Aids Control Organisation ) has already prescribed testing for all pregnant women.

A recent mortality investigation carried out by semi-government entity Institute of Actuaries of India on people living with HIV (PLHIV) shows among the deceased, the illiterate population make for the higher number, unprotected sex is still the commonest reason behind the transmission of HIV, those between 25 and 49 years of age bear 83% of the death burden and there is a significant time gap between a person getting infected and him/her seeking treatment. The study investigated 1,695 deaths between April 2012 and March 2013 in 20 ART centres of five districts, representative of the whole country.The study, carried out with support from the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), is supposed to act as a guide for insurers to design the life insurance cover for PLHIV and price the risks accordingly. In its report, the IAI has suggested that CD4 count at the time of registering for ART, access to regular treatments and educational, economical and social backwardness were among major factors for longevity of life. It has recommended stricter data development and maintenance to NACO The survey report underlines how the uneducated population contributes to 44% of the deaths, even though the rate of infection among them is only about 27%. Education, say experts, clearly has a defining role to play in HIV care but how and why is subject to further exploration. The report says the average time lost before a patient approaches a free anti-retroviral centre is about 7.4 months. “A delay in starting treatment could lead to faster deterioration of a patients’ health and s/he may also fall prey to opportunistic infections, like TB,” said a volunteer with one of the city’s 69 Integrated Testing and Counselling Centres.Most worryingly, the study revealed that in 90% of the deaths, the infection was transmitted through unprotected sex. A NACO official told TOI that despite the exponential success rate of condom use, unprotected sex remained a nagging worry. In Mumbai too, it is a challenge to check the transmission of the virus among high-risk groups such as men having sex with men (MSM). “Over the last five years, MSM in Mimbai has witnessed a drop of 88% in HIV transmission.

He added: “The homosexual act will not disappear but the community seeking help will reduce drastically. Now while treating male patients, doctors cannot ask, ‘Have you indulged in sex with a man,’ and this will have a major impact on detecting new cases.”Dr Kabir Sardana of Delhi’s Maulana Azad Medical College too said that gay patients suffering from STDs may no longer report their illness for fear of being branded an outlaw.In one of its report, the Human Rights Watch had highlighted the bitter truth that India’s battle against HIV/AIDS was made harder by the criminality attached to vulnerable communities. Some of the challenges underscored were thankfully overcome owing to the Delhi HC ruling in 2009 decriminalising gay sex. But, with the latest SC verdict, the obstacles will get resurrected.The issue is particularly pressing. MSMs are a high-risk category for HIV/AIDS. About 7% of the estimated 25-lakh gay persons in India are HIV-infected, according to the Central government. Their marginalization in healthcare was in fact the basis of the public interest litigation filed by the Naz Foundation in Delhi HC.The National AIDS Control Organisation too had conceded in the HC that Section 377 seriously impeded successful public health interventions. “Those in the high-risk group are reluctant to reveal same-sex behaviour due to the fear of law enforcement agencies, keeping a large section invisible and unreachable and thereby pushing the cases of infection underground, making it very difficult for public health workers to even access them,” stated the affidavit.The Human Rights Watch report cited an instance from July 2001, when four NGO staffers in Lucknow working to fight HIV/AIDS among MSMs were arrested and charged under IPC Section 377 (unnatural offences) and for selling obscene material. They were imprisoned for 47 days. Their literature was seized. And the offices of their two NGOs, Naz Foundation and Bharosa Trust, were sealed.The harassment they suffered has been endured over the years by scores of other health workers in Chennai, Bangalore and Delhi.“This (verdict) will have a devastating impact on the fight against HIV/AIDS. In the early days, it was very hard to get MSMs to health units, as they feared police action. This changed only after the Delhi HC judgment,” said Dr L Ramakrishnan of Solidarity and Action Against the HIV Infection in India. Dr Ramakrishnan said the SC ruling was likely to give legal backing to the biases of some healthcare professionals and fuel their discriminatory attitudes.The Anti Retroviral Therapy centre in the Government General Hospital in Chennai had seen a rise in gay patients with HIV coming to them for treatment after the Delhi HC verdict in 2009. “The number MSMs approaching NGOs doubled from 4% to 8%,” said a senior doctor at the hospital.Bhavana, programme manager of Sahodaran, a male sexual health project, said: “If homosexuality is legalised, we can freely distribute condoms to same sex couples. It would have also encouraged people to come out. This verdict will have a negative impact on intervention programmes.”(With inputs from Kamini Mathai, Madhavi Rajadhyaksha, Durgesh Nandan Jha)","['hivaids', 'blow', 'hiv', 'msms', 'verdict', 'body', 'patients', 'delhi', 'sex', 'hc', 'health', 'fight', 'gay']","Some of the challenges underscored were thankfully overcome owing to the Delhi HC ruling in 2009 decriminalising gay sex.

Though that type of treatment was useful to bring down the number of births of HIV-positive babies, the Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TANSACS) that decided to eradicate it completely, made a change in the treatment method. As per the new method, the Nevirapine tablets should be taken by HIV-positive mothers for 14 weeks during pregnancy and the babies should be given Nevirapine syrup for at least six months.Dr Manivannan, medical officer of the ART centre in Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH), Trichy said that the new regimen of treatment was proved to be effective to ensure the birth of HIV-negative babies born to HIV-positive mothers. ""We work towards achieving the target of nil birth of HIV-positive babies in 2015. We hope it will be possible to reach the target with the present mode of treatment to the HIV-positive mothers.
