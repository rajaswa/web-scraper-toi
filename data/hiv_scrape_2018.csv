It started from Surat and then expanded to include HIV positive marriage seekers of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. This is first time that the HIV positive people seeking life partners will be arriving in the city from more than 10 states across the country.If the volunteers of GSNP+ are to be believed then around 800 registrations of the HIV positive people seeking life partners have come in from Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, New Delhi, Punjab, West Bengal, Rajasthan and two other states.“Unlike every year, this time around we have expanded our marriage mela to more than 10 states in the country. The marriage mela is going to be unique this time as marriage seekers will have a broad choice to select their life partners from different states,” GSNP+ president Daxa Patel said.There is a higher proportion of infected men as compared to women. Owing to higher proportion of infected men, prospective brides usually get a greater freedom in choosing their partners.The marriage mela will be held at Reliance HIV and TB Centre at Hazira where men would walk up on stage and formally introduce themselves, talking about their profession and income, in front of an audience comprising mostly prospective brides and their family members.“The prospective grooms and brides have freedom to choose their partners as they walk on stage and talk about themselves. Once the groom and bride like each other, the next stage will be to consult their parents or relatives besides mutual consent,” Patel said. She said for the first time female participants in the marriage mela will be reimbursed all their travelling and other expenses with the help of Reliance Foundation.","['states', 'stage', 'fair', 'surat', 'hazira', 'mela', 'brides', 'positive', 'partners', 'life', 'nationallevel', 'marriage', 'hiv']","Surat: HIV-positive people seeking life partners from more than 10 states in the country will descend on Hazira near Surat to participate in a marriage fair or ‘jeevansathi pasandgi mela’ being organized on Saturday.The first of its kind national marriage fair is being organized by Gujarat State Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS (GSNP+), a non-governmental organization (NGO) offering free consultation services for HIV positive brides and grooms, in association with Reliance Industries Limited (RIL).The marriage fair for the HIV positive people is being organized every year for the last 10 years.

The Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) will initiate the project on a pilot basis at the antiretroviral therapy centres in Madras Medical College and at the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Egmore, which have around 5,000 HIV-positive patients enrolled in the state programme.K Senthil Raj, TANSACS project director, said the patients will also be given a login id, so that they can access their records, including lab results and next appointment with doctors, through their phones. “Starting from the counsellor to the staff nurse and then finally the doctor, details of the patients will be fed into the system. The doctors will have a dashboard with the patient’s medical history,” he said.At present, 1.2 lakh people with HIV are on the antiretroviral therapy programme run by the government.Officials say once a patient tests positive for HIV, the ART centre maintains a ‘white card’ with the patient’s details, while the patient is given a notebook that carries information on their drugs intake and their CD4 count – an important indicator of the immune function and the strongest predictor of HIV progression. A doctor at an ART centre here said many of these cards are simply discarded. “Walk into any of these centres and you will see these cards lying in some corner, gathering dust. We usually refer to the notebooks these patients bring. Mostly we go by the information they provide,” admitted the doctor.The TANSACS director, too, said poor documentation was a problem. “We also have duplication. A patient who registers at an ART centre in one district later moves to a centre in another district and enrolls as a new patient,” he said, adding that maintaining electronic records will do away with this challenge. “We will also be able to track them better.”Tamil Nadu has AIDS testing centres at all district headquarters with more than 55 ART centres and 750 Integrated (Voluntary) and Confidential Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) under the National AIDS Control Programme at district level government hospitals and medical colleges across the state. Patients, who are confirmed HIV-positive, visit ART centres at least once a month for drugs and testing.While NGOs and experts working with people living with HIV have welcomed the move, they said digitalisation could also raise concerns on privacy. “Many of them lie low as they don’t want people around them to know they are infected. They will be wary if they know their details are available online. The state needs to assuage this by holding awareness camps,” said Vijay Raman from Voluntary Health Services which undertakes projects related to HIV/AIDS among the transgender community.In an effort to fight misinformation on sexually transmitted infections and diseases, the Tamil Nadu state AIDS control society will soon revamp its website to make it more interactive. Public can clarify doubts about condom use, STDs and STIs by emailing a group of counsellors dedicated for this. The website will be launched on January 11.","['aids', 'centre', 'tracking', 'state', 'patients', 'digital', 'centres', 'tamil', 'patient', 'works', 'district', 'medical', 'nadu', 'art', 'hiv']","CHENNAI: Medical records of HIV patients in the state will now go digital.

The good news is that the deadly viral disease continues to be on a decline among general population. The worrying part: In certain pockets of the state, the disease is raging among high-risk populations like female sex workers.According to the HSS, Maharashtra is 16th in terms of HIV prevalence, a positive shift of four places since the last survey in 2014-15. From 0.29%, the prevalence has reduced to 0.26%. An official from the Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS) said it was a significant drop as the HIV prevalence is now lower than the national average of 0.28%.But experts say it’s still not time to rejoice as certain sites catering to high-risk populations such as men having sex with men (MSM), injecting drug users and female sex workers have shown a significant prevalence. Though Maharashtra is one of the states to record less than 5% HIV positivity in female sex workers, there are four sites where the prevalence has been found to be 5%. At one site, it was around 10%. Among the female sex workers in the state, the prevalence (3.48%) is more than double the national average (1.56%).Nagpur-based NGO Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS) that has been working with female sex workers said migration has emerged as a major challenge over the years. “Commercial sex workers have started migrating and moving out of traditional pockets making it difficult to track, test or treat them. It poses a direct threat to the general population,” said Hemlata Lohave from IRCS. She added that dwindling financial resources, too, have made their job difficult. “Often we are working without funds for months. Even now, for instance, we haven’t received money for the last quarter. We regularly lose trained workers as we can’t pay salaries,” she said.Among MSMs, the state is fifth on the national chart with the prevalence hovering around 4.69%, which is higher than the national average of 2.69%. However, in HSS 2014-15, the HIV prevalence among female sex workers was 7.4% and 4.9% among MSMs.Mumbai, too, is one of the sites with high HIV prevalence among truckers. There were nine sites with more than 1% HIV prevalence among long-distance truckers, including Mumbai with 1.2% prevalence.The MDACS official said the state is working on newer strategies. “We are aware that infections are still high in metropolitan cities. In high-risk pockets, we are testing at the community level. We are also looking at multi-month dispensation of antiretroviral drugs so that a patient can come to us once in three months rather than every month,” he said.","['prevalence', 'highrisk', 'sex', 'sites', 'working', 'rages', 'workers', 'female', 'state', 'groups', 'national', 'pockets', 'wanes', 'maha', 'hiv']","MUMBAI: The recently released HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) report has some good as well as worrying news for the state.

A study conducted by the society has found that the Elisa test was more effective than nucleic test.HIV screening had become a matter of concern following the detection of the virus in a kid, who underwent blood transfusion at Regional Cancer Centre. Now, National AIDS Control Organisation has informed that it would supply Elisa test kits to the state.""For the time being, we have supplied enough kits to all government medical college hospitals and Regional Cancer Centre. Moreover, Kerala State Medical Services Corporation (KMSCL) has also been asked to procure the kits, which will be supplied to all the blood banks and hospitals with blood banks,'' said Dr R Ramesh , managing director of KSACS.As per the study, in the nucleic test the virus could not be detected even for a week after the blood is collected. ""But Elisa test gives more accurate result even during the first one week window period,'' said Dr Ramesh.In the past one year, KSACS collected 4 lakh blood units, of which 300 were detected with HIV using the third generation Elisa test. ""In the past four years, we might have collected about 25 lakh blood units and only in one case it has gone undetected (in the RCC incident). Hence our testing facilities are accurate. With this 4th generation test, we can assure 100% safety and accuracy,'' he pointed out.Now, KSACS has decided to go for a wide-spread campaign for voluntary blood donation since it is the only safe way for collecting the blood units.""We have achieved only 60% in voluntary blood donation and the remaining is still replacement blood donation.

After that, the baby will be handed over to the child welfare committee. But, we will treat and monitor the child for 18 months. Another set of tests will be conducted then to ascertain if the baby has contracted the disease,” he said.According to Soundaravel, as many as 12 babies were abandoned in the city last year. “They were admitted to Don Bosco Anbu Illam and almost all of them are getting education in government and corporation schools.

It will measure the quantity of HIV virus in patients and help doctors decide their treatment regime.Hitherto, the test was conducted only after the first line of drugs failed, which would happen after 5-7 years of patients being diagnosed with HIV, and result in them losing golden time in starting new medicines.On Saturday, Naco instructed all state governments to get patients to undergo routine viral load tests and check mortality rate. A staggering 80,173 people have died of HIV over the past decade in Karnataka, according to the death audit conducted by Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS).A total of 3.1 lakh people living with HIV (PLHIV) have registered for ART in the state. Across the country, an estimated 21 lakh HIV positive patients are registered with 525 ART centres. Bengaluru has seven such centres.While 3,16,252 people living with HIV have registered for ART treatment in Karnataka as on December 2017, only 1, 65,917 of them actively turn up for follow-ups. The rest are either dead or don’t visit the centres.The practice till date was to get a patient, whose blood tests positive for HIV, to undergo a CD4 count before starting anti-retro viral drugs. CD4 count is a prognostic indicator where a higher number indicates a stronger immune system. Henceforth, the patient will have to undergo a viral load test too while registering for ART treatment.“The cost of viral load test in the private sector ranges from Rs 4,000-6,000 and not all can afford it. The government will be spending Rs 1,200 per test,” said an officer from KSAPS.This Naco move will be implemented from February 8 through M/s Metropolis Healthcare Limited under a public-private partnership ( PPP ) project. In the first year, the agency will conduct 2.1 lakh tests. The remaining patients will be covered in a phased manner.“Currently, the programme was using targeted viral load testing to confirm suspected treatment failure owing to clinical or immunological failure of the patient. From now on, patients on ART will be monitored via viral load test at regular intervals. The result will allow early detection of potential treatment failure,” a senior officer in KSAPS said.Naco had also set a timeline to be followed while conducting viral load testing. “For patients on the first line of treatment, the test should be done twice in the first year, once every six months. From the second year onwards, it should happen once a year. For second/third line patients, it must be conducted once every six months after the patient’s initiation on ART,” said KSAPS officers.However, NGOs closely working with people living with HIV (PHIV) in creating awareness have questioned the government’s partnership with a private entity. “There is a HIV law in place and the rules are likely to be framed by April 2018. Even before formulating the rules, why has the government tied up with a private party? Besides, if the private agency conducts tests only on 2.1 lakh of the total 21 lakh people registered for ART treatment in the country, it will cover only 10%. What about the rest? Instead, viral load tests should have been mandated for all HIV patients once every six months,” said David Bodapatti, who has been working with PLHIV.HIV positive people on active ART careAdult males: 69,376Adult females: 84,409Transgenders, Transsexuals: 373Male children: 6,443Female children: 5,316Total: 1,65,917Source: KSAPS (figures as on Dec 2017)","['treatment', 'test', 'load', 'registered', 'patients', 'mandates', 'naco', 'check', 'viral', 'mortality', 'lakh', 'tests', 'art', 'hiv']","BENGALURU: In what could be a game changer in treating HIV patients, the National AIDS Control Organization (Naco) has decided that all patients registered for anti-retroviral therapy (ART) will undergo viral load testing.

Deep Chand (name changed), sobbing inconsolably , is an embodiment of that mortifying scare. In the past three months, 38 people from this locality of Bangarmau tehsil have been found HIV positive at screening camps in the past three months. The needle of suspicion is pointed towards a quack, Rajendra Yadav , who has been held.Till a few months ago, Deep Chand was just like most men from Prem Ganj, working as a 'palledar' (loader) at the nearby grain market. But a few months ago, his body started saying 'no' to humongous sacks he would carry on his back to make a living. Continuous excruciating pain in the lower back took him to Yadav's Station Road clinic in Bangarmau, the destination for many in his neighbourhood needing cheap medical help. But relief eluded him. Last month, at a camp in Prem Ganj to screen HIV cases he, along with his wife and son, tested positive. Now, he has to report to Kanpur ART Centre, 50 km away, for regular check-up and medication which is free.He also has four daughters. But fearing worst, he has not made them undergo the test. ""I am not fit and don't earn like before. What will happen if they, too, are tested positive? Medicine is free, but I don't have money to take six people to Kanpur. I can't even afford the cost of copies and pencils,"" he vents his angst.Two other nearby villages under the virus onslaught are Chakmeera and Kidmiyapur. Among the victims is a 70-year-old and also six-year-old girl. Her parents, however, are not infected. This has flummoxed local health officials.Rajendra Yadav, who would run his clinic from the corridor of an old Sanskrit school on the Station Road and is said to have infected many from the locality with infected syringes, was Dr 'Fixit' for the people. As per Deepu, a local youth, patients would make a beeline before his clinic before he would open it at 9am. Till the time he would call it a day around 11pm, he would have seen more than 150 patients.""People from adjoining areas would also throng his dispensary. He used to charge Rs 10 for three doses of medicine and an injection shot. He would carry a 'jhola' in which he usually kept his medical kit, including used syringes, which he would wash from the hand-pump water,"" Deepu says.Prem Ganj came under the radar of health officials in November last when 13 people from the locality tested HIV positive at a camp held by UP State Aids Control Society. At three repeat camps in the last week of January, 25 more cases popped up. “Nearly 270 people from Prem Ganj had got themselves examined at the camps out of which 25 tested positive.

The health department issued fresh guidelines to all district chief medical and health officers (CMHO) on Wednesday to rein in these frauds.What adds to the worry is that Madhya Pradesh State AIDS Control Society does not list these cases in its HIV sentinel surveillance. As per MPSACS data, there are 7,021 intravenous drug users being monitored at their anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centres. Sources say 28 of them (0.4%) were infected with HIV due to the behavioural practices of addicts — sharing needles. The data does not say if the infection was attributed to quacks.“We target high-risk population and the data is year-marked. Unqualified doctors will be monitored and action will be taken against them. Fresh instructions to this effect have been issued on Wednesday,” said MPACS project direct Umesh Kumar. “Crackdown on quacks is a law and order problem. From the standpoint of the health department, only the chief health officer can recommend action to the district administration,” he added.However, the health department could not provide ready data on action initiated against quacks in 51 districts of MP.

There is a high percentage of patients battling these deadly infections in the city,” pointed out Mujtaba Hasan Askari , president Helping Hand Foundation , an NGO which works with HIV patients.Recently, over 50 people were found to be infected with HIV in Unnao in Uttar Pradesh due to use of unsafe medical devices. Experts say mushrooming of blood banks, improper screening of blood and lack of checks were to be blamed for the spread of HIV.“The Telangana State Aids Control Society (TSACS) data may not reflect the true picture of new cases being infected through syringes and blood transfusion. Also, the fact that blood transfusion standards are not maintained as many private blood banks have mushroomed. Absence of checks, regulations and safety protocols make matters worse,” Askari pointed out.Interestingly, the latest and most-updated technology available to detect HIV, nucleic acid test (NAT), is not available in majority of the blood banks in the state.Currently, ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test as well as manual screening is carried out in majority of blood banks in the state, but these test have their limitations.“For ELISA test to detect HIV, the virus should have been active for at least 40 days before the test. Also, the manual testing method (for ELISA third generation) has the possibility of the virus not getting detected at all due to human error. Though NAT is the safest (can detect the virus if it has been in the body for seven days), it is a costly affair,” T Vishnu Vardhan, chief executive officer, NTR Trust Blood Bank , said.Of 136 blood banks in the city, 43 facilities, including state-run blood banks, were being supported by National Aids Control Organization (NACO). And, less than five actually conduct NAT. NACO currently supplies the third generation manual ELISA kit to supported blood banks. “The ELISA test is followed by almost all government as well as private sector blood banks. While one possibility is that the basic antibody test that we are doing does not detect HIV as the antibody has not yet been developed, the possibility of erroneous blood banks, negligence and a small possibility of re-use of syringes cannot be ruled out,” Dr V Rajasekhar, project director, TSACS, said. “So far, no incident of blood banks totally avoiding blood screening has come to our notice,” he added.Also, once blood banks discover that a patient was HIV positive, they should inform, counsel and inform the TSACS and send the patient to the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) in the district. “Usually, the blood banks do not take it to the logical end when they find a patient is positive, they tend to wash their hands off,” say insiders.","['jabs', 'jaws', '100', 'banks', 'push', 'syringe', 'blood', 'test', 'possibility', 'dialysis', 'screening', 'transfusion', 'death', 'syringes', 'infected', 'virus', 'elisa', 'hiv']","Also, the fact that blood transfusion standards are not maintained as many private blood banks have mushroomed.

Patients in Maharashtra too have, over the years, claimed to have contracted HIV through infected needles or syringes.An RTI response from National Aids Control Society (NACO) showed that over 500 people in the state have got HIV through infected needles. Between 2012-13 and 2016-17, 512 disclosed at Integrated Centres for Testing and Counselling (ICTCs) that exposure to infected needle was responsible for the infection, said RTI activist Chetan Kothari. Numbers suggest an average 70-200 people get HIV through infected needles every year. In 2017-18, 69 people, including 29 women, contracted the infection.But the numbers have been highly debated by state agencies working towards controlling the disease. Parimal Sinh, who heads the state Aids control society, said less than 0.5% of new infections are due to infected needles. Over 90% of the infection in the state happens through the heterosexual route.“More importantly, the needle-infection numbers are based on voluntary disclosures made by people during counselling sessions before and after they are tested for HIV in ICTCs. Often, patients tend to suggest blood transfusion and infection through needles as possible mode of transmission. While our counsellors try to find out the exact reason, we also have to keep in mind the mental state of the patient.”Medically too, a single needle usage may not necessarily mean transmission of HIV. Eldred Tellis of Sankalp Rehabilitation Trust, that has been working with intravenous drug users (IDUs), said the virus could survive for three hours in the bore of a needle as there is vacuum, but otherwise it would die within 10 seconds. “But since HIV is a weak virus, the viral load of the infected person has to be really high for transmission. Studies suggest that one in 10 persons will get HIV if the needle is infected.”Interestingly, the highest HIV prevalence (7%) in the country is among IDUs, who use addictive substances through injections by exchanging needles. “In most cases, they pull out blood and put it back in the syringe to extract maximum of the drug and inject into veins contributing to high HIV infection,” he said. Tellis added that the authorities must also think of hepatitis C infection as that transmits more efficiently than HIV. “In Mumbai IDUs, hepatitis prevalence is around 35%, whereas HIV is 9.5%,” he said.","['infection', 'idus', 'contracted', 'suggest', '500', 'needle', 'state', 'patients', 'needles', 'transmission', 'rti', 'numbers', 'maharashtra', 'infected', 'hiv']","MUMBAI: Transmission of HIV through infected needles doesn’t seem to be restricted to villages in Uttar Pradesh alone.

An FIR is being registered against three quacks while notices are being served to 44 others, who have been unable to produce degrees or relevant documents for running clinics,” Unnao chief medical officer (CMO) Dr S P Chowdhary told TOI on Saturday.“If ‘doctors’ are not registered with the Medical Council of India, they have no right to practice medicine. We are taking action on complaints of quackery,” the CMO added.An official spokesman said while some of these quacks were operating from their houses, others had opened clinics.“Officials have been asked to verify the credentials of the quacks who run advertisements on local TV channels in the district. The health department teams will also request cable operators to stop advertisements promoting tantriks and quacks,” he added.Meanwhile, HIV affected people of the three villagers of Bangarmau — Prem Ganj, Chakmir and Kirmidiyapur — have demanded setting up of an antiretroviral therapy (ART) link centre at Bangarmau community health centre (CHC) to facilitate cheap and affordable treatment.At present, patients are being treated at the ART centre of Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial (GSVM) medical college in Kanpur. ART is a therapy that improves the life quality of HIV patients with treatment that maximally suppresses the HIV virus.“My 10-year-old daughter is HIV positive,” said Vinay (name changed), describing how his entire family makes a three-hour-long journey from Premganj where they live to the medical college in Kanpur every month.“My daughter depends on antiretroviral therapy given at the ART centre to keep living. We can’t afford the fare any longer. It would be better if the authorities establish a link centre at Bangarmau CHC itself,” said Vinay.His views were echoed by Sudarshan (name changed), a truck driver and a father of a 12-year-old HIV positive son. Residents of Chakmir, Sudarshan and his wife travel to Kanpur every month for treatment of their son and the bus ride costs Rs 800 per trip.“The amount spent on travelling to the nearest ART centre should be reimbursed. Moreover, the government should set up a link centre here, else I would have no option but to skip treatment,” he said.Local social activists said what is worrying is that of the total 58 HIV positive cases identified so far during screening in the three villages, only 25 have visited the ART centre.“ART treatment can’t cure HIV/AIDS . There is still no outright cure for the disease, and it does not go away by itself. But ARTs do slow down the damage that the virus does to the immune system, and allow people to live long, productive lives like everyone else, without succumbing to the disease,” said an activist.A senior health official at ART centre, meanwhile, said there were several reasons why patients avoid medication. “They usually do not want to reveal their condition to their near and dear ones. Many skip the treatment out of the fear that others will find out about their condition,” he said.At least 58 persons tested positive for HIV in Bangarmau after a quack allegedly used infected syringes to treat scores of his patients. Of these, 33 were detected at a blood donation camp on February 3 while 25 had come to light last year.","['affected', 'centre', 'treatment', 'bangarmau', 'clinics', 'health', 'quacks', '73', 'positive', 'patients', 'sealed', 'medical', 'art', 'hiv']","BANGARMAU: Health authorities have taken action against 73 quacks by sealing their clinics in various localities of Bangarmau tehsil in Unnao district following spread of HIV in three villages due to alleged treatment by a quack.“As many 73 clinics of alleged quacks have been sealed.

Of this, 42 are under the Chennai Corporation and four are monitored directly by Tamil Nadu AIDS Control Society (TANSACS).However, with HIV featuring bottom-most in the city health department’s priority list -- following a drop in prevalence over the years -- counsellors at various ICTCs complain that lab technicians in these centers are often deputed to other departments in Corporation hospitals. “Screening is often affected in the process,” said a counsellor. “Patients are either asked to wait or return later, but they rarely do as most of them are part of a floating population,” she said.The 42 ICTCs under corporation are managed by Chennai Corporation AIDS Prevention and Control Society ( CAPACS ), a body set up by National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) in the late 90s, along with similar city-wings in Mumbai and Ahmedabad. In 2016, NACO, following a decline in HIV prevalence in Ahmedabad and Chennai, wrote to the state AIDS control societies in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu asking them to merge the city-specific operations with the state.A senior official in TANSACS said of the Rs 69 crore the state receives every year from NACO, at least Rs 6.9 crore goes for paying salaries of around 100 CAPACS staff. “The department is cash-strapped right now with NACO slashing funds. CAPACS is an additional burden,” he said.Besides, financial difficulties, officials say the merger will also benefit HIV patients. “Besides helping us monitor these centres better, we can also fill the vacancies by deputing staff from ICTCs in other districts where the prevalence is low,” he said.

Of them, 48 have died while the remaining are on anti-retroviral therapy. The village, barely 18km from a government hospital, was home to around 500 families at that time. At least one member from each was working in Maharashtra or Gujarat. With migrant population believed to be a major reason for the virus, HIV came to be known as ‘Mumbai wali bimari’ here.Today, 90% of the 700 houses in the village have someone working in Maharashtra but no new case has been reported in the past five years.Women have driven the change by openly talking about prevention, claim health activists and officials. Caution has become their second nature.“Women maketheir husbands get themselves tested for HIV at least once a year,” said Vidya Devi, who was a newly wed in 2005. Anganwadi worker Gyan Swaroopa has been a hero of HIV prevention by counselling the women. Breaking barriers of shame and harassment—there is fear of being teased by men for talkingabout sex—she speaks openly to every boy who heads to Mumbai. “Isme kahekisharam... jaan hai to jahan hai (Why be ashamed of doing my duty. Health and survival are the most important),” she reasons.As a result, the air of stigma around HIV is absent in this village.“You can pose direct questions on HIV here unlike in other villages. In fact, HIV testing is considered even at the onset of a simplefever,” saidRajendra Sahu of Nehru Yuva Sangathan Tisi, a social organisation working to create awareness around HIV/ AIDS. Village head Jagatpal said: “The men have been told to have sex only with their wives. The elders keep an eye on the behaviour of their children. Those in Mumbai keep an eye on each other and ensure that no one gets deviated. Medical advice is taken for every disease. Even a simple fever is not ignored and HIV testing is done.”“No HIV positive case has been reported from this village in five years,” said Dr SP Jauhari, secretary of the district aids control society. However, HIV cases in Fatehpur district have continued to rise. Against 97 cases in 2014, 163 cases were reported in 2017. January alone this year has seen 27 cases, data from the health department shows.","['seen', 'udai', 'fresh', 'working', 'villages', 'case', 'bangarmau', 'cases', 'hivaffected', 'fatehpurs', 'health', 'village', 'town', 'reported', 'sarai', 'hiv']","UDAI SARAI (Fatehpur): Residents of this small village in Fatehpur district would empathise with HIV-affected Bangarmau town in Unnao the most.More than 12 years ago, their village had hit headlines for reporting a large number of HIV positive cases in a health camp.
The incident had lent Udai Sarai a negative image, feel its residents, some of them relieved that the tag is now for Bangarmau’s villages.
“Whenever I told people I was from Udai Sarai, they used to quickly check if it was the same HIV village that made news a few years ago.
Take the case of our village, no new HIV case has been reported in Udai Sarai for a few years.
However, HIV cases in Fatehpur district have continued to rise."

The data further revealed that 0.22% men were HIV positive with their wives being HIV negative. Similarly, in 0.22% it was the wife who was HIV positive while the husband was not HIV positive.The survey also brought to light the failure of the government to create awareness about HIV. According to the data released, only 69% of men and 43% of women were aware that use of condoms during sex can prevent HIV. Among men, Gujarat ranked 10 from the bottom when it came to knowledge of condoms and women were the fourth worst, better only than Bihar, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Nagaland.The data reveals the awareness of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV/AIDS was very poor in Gujarat among women, Dadra and Nagar Haveli has the lowest awareness (16%) of MTCT, followed by Bihar (33%) and Gujarat (34%).The data further reveals that only 59% women were aware of HIV, while among 77% men had awareness about HIV. The data further reveals that only 1% of women had high-risk intercourse in 2015-16 while 6.8% of men had high-risk intercourse in same period. Also, only 23.6% women and men knew how to prevent HIV/AIDS and another 20% had comprehensive knowledge. Divyang Oza, the project officer of the AIDS Control Society said that teenage groups are the most affected and the most common mode of infection was sexual transmission. The second strongest mode for HIV transmission is blood transfusion. It also cannot be denied that many couples only use condom for family planning and are unaware that it can be used to prevent HIV. Oza further said that HIV awareness has to be increased, but it is a time-consuming process and while there has been an improvement, it is less than expected.","['reveals', '1524', 'women', 'gujarat', 'group', 'men', 'age', 'prevalent', 'positive', 'awareness', 'data', 'hiv']","AHMEDABAD: Data released by the National Family Health Survey reveals that the 0.30% of males in the age group of 15-24 were found to be HIV positive.

But their HIV-positive status has turned them into social pariahs, with the city offering them no space to pursue their entrepreneurial dreams.Out to open their own café called “Cafe Positive”, all they have met with for the last three months is a big negative. No house-owner in some of south Kolkata’s posh localities has been willing to rent out space once told about “who will manage and run the shop”.While a few landlords have straightaway refused saying “e paray erom cholbena (such business won’t run in this neighbourhood)”, others have been courteous enough with financial help and old clothes, but pleaded helplessness in renting out space to the 18-plus teens.The NGO funding the café and trying to find a 750sqft space has approached over a dozen owners since December at locations like Golpark, Dover Lane, Lake Road , Hindustan Park and Purna Das Road. “We have been looking for a suitable space for the café since December and approached a number of house-owners directly and through brokers. The owners initially seemed excited at the concept, but the moment they learnt that the shop will be managed and run solely by HIV-positive children, they backed out,” said Kallol Ghosh , founder of Anandaghar, a shelter for abandoned HIV/AIDS-infected children.TOI spoke to two house-owners, one at Lake Road and the other at Dover Lane. “I would not mind renting out space to them. But we live in a joint family and some members have objections. I could not convince them, so I rejected the offer,” said a landlady.The house-owner at Dover Lane, too, blamed her neighbours and family. “I don’t know how people in our neighbourhood would react to it. I know there are many misconceptions associated with HIV . I don’t think I am in a position to convince everyone. Moreover, I have now decided to rent the space to a boutique and not an eatery,” he said.The Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (Prevention and Control) Bill, 2017 defines what can count as discrimination against HIV-positive people. It lists that denial or discontinuation of employment, education, healthcare services, renting or residing property, standing for public or private office will count as discrimination along with unfair treatment in any of the above mentioned categories.The shelter at Narendrapur is home to around 70-odd young patients and this café project is part of an initiative to make a group self-sufficient. The NGO will give the initial funds and later hand over the management of the café to the 10 boys and girls, who would be running it.“We have been undergoing training at this shelter and can’t wait to start our café. We know the disease we suffer from and how it spreads or what precautions we need to take. But strangely, the adults don’t understand that HIV doesn’t spread through touch and often hesitate to even shake hands with us,” said Susanta Pal (name changed), a Class XII student who was diagnosed with HIV when he was just 5.“HIV does not spread by kissing, hugging, sharing food/drink, toilet seats, sweat, touching, sneeze/cough or through insect bites. We also want society to know about these from our café. But for that, we first need an opportunity,” said Sathi Biswas (name changed), another Class XII student who specialises in sandwich-making and baking cookies.According to the plan, food and beverages at the 750sqft ground-floor café will be served on disposable plates and there will be no sharp cutleries or glass items that can cause bleeding. “We are not looking for any exceptions or rebate and are ready to pay as per the existing market rate but even then not a single house-owner is ready,” lamented Ghosh.","['space', 'lane', 'dream', 'house', 'hits', 'café', 'shelter', 'road', 'run', 'kolkata', 'hurdle', 'know', 'renting', 'houseowner', 'hivpositive', 'hiv']","KOLKATA: They are a bunch of 10 ordinary teenagers, who nourish the dream of making it big.

From organizing awareness camps to marriage fairs for HIV patients and successfully running a day-boarding school and hostel for HIV-infected children, Daxa has put her life, blood and sweat for their uplift.“When my husband and I were diagnosed with HIV in 1997, there was no treatment available. Meanwhile, I got pregnant and had no choice but to go for termination. One of the doctors told me that my lifespan was just for five months. I was searching for a person infected with HIV and I found a woman who was living with the disease for two years. This gave me confidence that I could also live long. This was the turning point in my life,” says 42-year-old Daxa.Daxa, who was doing a small embroidery business from her house, and her husband informed their family and relatives about the disease. To their surprise, the family was very supportive and this further boosted her confidence on fighting discrimination faced by people like her. Her treatment began only in 2007, 10 years after he was infected.It was in 2003, Daxa, who was earlier working as a counsellor with a city-based non-governmental organization SAHAS, got in touch with Umesh Patel. Along with Umesh and other few community members, they decided to launch a platform for HIV positive people. This is how the Gujarat State Network for People Living with HIV/ÁID (GSNP+) was launched in 2003.The main objective of GSNP+ was to assist the people infected with HIV/AIDS, ensure they get proper medical attention and timely medicines and organizing awareness programmes etc.“We used to meet the HIV patients at some deserted places and gardens to protect their identity. We started with just 35 members at GSNP+ and now we have 67,000 members across all the districts in Gujarat,” she said.Later, the NCPI+ was launched at the national level and the organization has a presence in 32 states across the country. Daxa is also running Janani Dham for the destitute HIV and AIDS infected orphaned children on the outskirts of the city since 2009. It is supported by Gujarat government’s social justice department and Surat-based P P Savani Group and has around 98 boys and girls.GSNP+ will soon launch a scheme for HIV positive people, where they can get easy medicine refill and won’t have to visit government dispensaries.

It is under the ‘Viral load testing for all people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV)’ initiative launched by the Union ministry of health and family welfare on February 26 this year.The ART centres selected in Bihar are at Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) Patna and Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH), Muzaffarpur.Total 530 ART centres have been selected for free viral load testing of 12 lakh PLHIV on treatment in the country at least once a year.The central government has tied up with a private laboratory in Mumbai under public-private partnership (PPP) mode to provide viral load testing facility to patients across the country. A senior state health department official said samples would be collected from the three ART centres and flown to the Mumbai laboratory for test. “A hard copy of the report will be sent to the state,” he said.Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) targets and destroys CD4 T cells that strengthen immunity in a person. Patients with a CD4 count below 200 are susceptible to develop serious illnesses. Viral load testing essentially tells whether the ART treatment regimen is working or not by measuring the amount of virus in a patient’s blood.“In more than 95% cases, the viral load becomes undetectable after six months of ART treatment. Earlier, the only test conducted to measure the effectiveness of treatment was to check the immune level (CD4 test) in a patient. Sometimes, the patient also becomes drug-resistant after treatment and thus the viral load increases. With viral load testing in government ART centres, it will be possible to detect the increase of the viruses in the blood of the patient after treatment,” a member of International AIDS Society, Dr Diwakar Tejaswi, said.There are only three private labs in Patna for collecting samples for viral load testing and they charge approximately Rs4000- 4500 for one test.","['treatment', 'test', 'load', 'free', 'antiretroviral', 'testing', '19', 'centres', 'patients', 'patna', 'patient', 'viral', 'therapy', 'art', 'hiv']","PATNA: Three antiretroviral therapy (ART) centres in Bihar will carry out viral load testing for HIV/AIDS from April 19.

She is Meena Vij, who lost her husband to AIDS in 2004.She was in her second pregnancy in 1994 when she learnt she was HIV +ve. She aborted the child and confronted her husband, who ran a hotel. “After initial hesitance, he accepted his relationships with multiple partners,” said Meena, whose son is 27 now, and HIV negative.There was no ‘happily ever after’ in Meena’s life with her husband, but today she helps the people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Chandigarh find love. She has married off eight of them. Her face lights up at announcing that barring one, the rest of the couples are proud parents of HIV-negative children. “Of the myths about the disease, one is that the babies born to a mother with HIV also test positive,” Meena said. “People are unaware that if the mother and her baby receive proper medication during pregnancy and after birth, the chances of it are very less.”Meena is a member of the Chandigarh Network of People living with HIV/AIDS, or CNP+ for short. She is also a peer counsellor of Vihaan, a CNP+ programme. Network’s president Pooja Thakur was shunned by her in-laws when she tested positive along with her two sons a decade ago. Her eldest son, however, is HIV negative. Her husband died of AIDS. Pooja dared to go public about her HIV status in order to work for HIV awareness and counselling.Her positive attitude towards life rubbed on to several women and gave them the courage to live. One of them is today a member of Chandigarh State AIDS Control Society (SACS), CNP+, and Vihaan. She joined the network in 2007 after losing her husband to AIDS. She could move to Chandigarh with her four children because of a supportive brother.Created in November 2005, CNP+ meets on the 25th of every month, for tasks such as introducing new members, following up on the missed cases, and linking the members with ART centres. Today, the network has 1,000-plus registered members, who pay an annual subscription of Rs 100.CNP+ and Vihaan participate in many programmes of the state society. “We tell the PLHIV to visit the 12 integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTCs) in Chandigarh for free testing. We ask people to practice safe sex,” said Rahul, HIV+ve for more than 10 years.Meena said: “More important than fighting the disease is to fight the social stigma that keeps people from sharing their HIV status with family and taking treatment. We share our life stories with these people to boost their morale. We are living examples that with proper medication and diet, one can live with this virus for years,” said Meena, HIV +ve for 24 years.The PLHIVs live as outcasts. Family and friends discriminate against them, while even doctors judge them. Pooja asked for countrywide order for the doctors and clerks to write “universal precaution” instead of “HIV positive” on their hospital cards, “so that the chemists don’t look at us differently when they see the stamp”.“If our identity is revealed, our children won’t get admission in schools,” said a member of the network, seeking government support for a home for HIV-positive children and a higher monthly pension for widows and children from the present Rs 1,000 and Rs 700, respectively. Ask Pooja about the free bus pass in Chandigarh for PLHIVs and she has a hearty laugh. “For seven years, no progress,” she said.","['aids', 'attitude', 'meena', 'husband', 'chandigarh', 'positive', 'children', 'network', 'cnp', 'pooja', 'hiv']","She is Meena Vij, who lost her husband to AIDS in 2004.She was in her second pregnancy in 1994 when she learnt she was HIV +ve.

Dr Sreelatha P R, pediatrics department, MCH said that the girl died of leukemia. “She was admitted to the hospital on Wednesday and her condition was very serious,” the doctor said.The girl’s father said she was taken to the RCC after the doctors at the MCH diagnosed her with leukemia in February, 2017. The treatment for leukemia began on March 1, 2017. While she was under treatment at RCC the girl underwent blood transfusion several times. The girl was tested positive for HIV in August, 2017. “On October 5, our child was taken to a lab in Chennai for a detailed HIV test. However, the lab report said she was not HIV positive. The doctors at RCC said it was not a final report and they can confirm the presence of HIV only after getting a report from Delhi. But the doctors have not given that report us till date,” he said.The girl’s father said she was discharged from the RCC on November 1last year. “After that she was never taken to the RCC. We followed ayurveda treatment. But it did not work her. She was under the treatment of doctors at Alappuzha MCH. On Wednesday, her condition became serious and we took her to the MCH.

While the number remains a concern for officials, what is worrying them even more is that they could not establish the source of the disease in 32 children, an increase of 10. This has led officials to believe that more children are engaging in highrisk sexual behavior or are victims of abuse.In 2015, of the 311 children who tested positive for HIV/ AIDS in the state, 289 contracted the infection from their HIV-infected mothers during pregnancy, labour or breastfeeding. Officials couldn’t establish the source of the infection in 22 children. Two years later, the number of parent-to-child transmission dipped along with the number of new cases detected among children, but the number of unaccounted cases touched 32, show data furnished by Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society in response to an RTI application by TOI.Officials and doctors say they suspect the mode of transmission of the infection among these children to be sexual as the increase is corroborated by an uptick in the number of children referred to government-run clinics for sexually transmitted infections. The number went up from 6,234 in 2015 to 8,871last year.Recognising the growing prevalence of STIs among children, TANSACS project director K Senthil Raj said he is in talks with the school education secretary to dedicate more space to sex education in the soon-to-be-introduced revamped textbooks.He said staff at the integrated counselling and testing centers (ICTC) for HIV usually maintain a record of children with the infection, including those who haven’t got it from infected mothers. “They usually don’t probe. But if they do find the reason during the counselling, they maintain it in their notebooks,” he said. Some of the children, he said, could have acquired it through blood transfusion or injectable drugs.Consultant psychiatrist Dr M Suresh Kumar, who has worked extensively with injection drug users, rules out this possibility. “Heroin and other synthetic injectable opioids were popular till the late 90s. We haven’t been seeing young heroin addicts in a while,” saidDr Kumar.Hisobservation is backed by official data: Of the 1.43 lakh people living withHIVin TNcovered under the central-sponsored prevention programme, 56 are users of injectibles. All are in their 40s and above. Dr Kumar saidthey are,however, seeing other kinds of addictions, including marijuana and alcohol,on the rise among youngsters. “It is known that high drug use can make you vulnerable to engaging in high-risksexualbehavior,” he noted.HIV specialist Dr S Sundar observed that the state should expand its HIV/AIDS prevention programme to youngsters who aren’t part of the traditional “high-risk” group. “All our programmes are targeted at the high-risk population like female sex workers, transgenders, men who have sex with men and truck drivers. But ask a counsellor at an ICTC who he or sheseesthe most–itisusually people who are not part of this group,” hesaid. “Children are engaging in sexual activity belowthelegal ageof consent. It is a fact. They could be in a situation where nobody will even ask for consent,” added Sundar.Whatever be the source, once diagnosed, these children are forced to battle the stigma associated with the infection or live in the fear that someone may find out they are positive, said P Manorama, former chairperson of Child Welfare Committee, Chennai, who runs an organisation that works with children withHIV. Shesaidshe receives at least one child trafficking victim a year who tests positivefor HIVlinkedto sexualexploitation. “Butthey remain mere names in the state’s medical records. Officials don’t investigate further,” saidManorama, adding that TANSACS should coordinate with other departments to tackle these cases.","['infection', 'sex', 'sexual', 'cases', 'source', 'testing', 'state', 'positive', 'number', 'tamil', 'officials', 'children', 'mystery', 'nadu', 'rise', 'hiv']","CHENNAI: In 2017, 236 children below 18 years tested positive for HIV in the state, registering a near 25% decline in two years.

In past several years, only three to five units of HIV infected blood units had been timely detected annually.The rise implies that the number of HIV infected persons are increasing, and also that KGMU has been able to detect infected blood with much more precision by using the specialized Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT), than the previously used ELISA testing method to check donated blood for preventing infections via blood transfusion. Speaking at a programme on ‘Safe Blood Transfusion: Need of the Hour’, head of transfusion medicine department at KGMU, Prof Tulika Chandra said, “Blood transfusion runs a direct risk of contracting HIV if the blood is infected. We at KGMU have undertaken NAT since 2012. Since then, of the 3,10,000 units tested by NAT, 2,300 were found to be infected with HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C and were thus discarded.”But, it is not just 2,300 lives, that KGMU claims to have saved, depending on just conducting NAT on blood. “NAT helped save more than 9,000 lives by detecting 2,300 infected blood units that were discarded since four blood components would have been segregated from each unit, which equals to four patients and any one of this unit can be infected,” said Prof Chandra.She added that the number of HIV infected blood units has grown exponentially while cases of blood infected with Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B have gone down over the years.“There is an urgent need for blood transfusions to be made safe and the government should take note of this fact. Infected blood can be fatal if transfused to an ailing person. There is a phenomena called horizontal transfusion, which means that a person, transfused with infected blood, can give the infection to others in family through sexual and sometimes other means,” she added.Prof Chandra added that KGMU and SGPGIMS are the only centres using NAT while other government hospitals are still using the ELISA testing method.ELISA detects antibodies or antigens produced months after an infection is contracted and is thus futile for recent infections. NAT on the other hand, directly detects DNA or RNA of the infection causing virus present in the blood, making it more accurate.","['hivinfected', 'hepatitis', 'blood', 'kgmu', '11', 'testing', 'units', 'nat', 'transfusion', 'using', '17', 'infected', 'hiv']","LUCKNOW:In 2017, as many as 11units of blood donated at the community blood bank of King George’s Medical University ( KGMU ) were found to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

Between 2015 and 2016, the deaths rose by 166%.The HIV/AIDS epidemic, that had peaked in the nineties, has become manageable due to availability of medicines called antiretroviral treatment (ART); a fatal disease was soon transformed into achronic condition manageable with drugs. Number of deaths fell as a result even as the number of fresh HIV infections began to show a decline in the last few years.In this backdrop, the sudden spurt in deaths is worrisome, said doctors. A senior doctor, who didn’t want to be identified, said, “Deaths occur in poor patients in whom the current mode of treatment has failed.” Patients for whom the first line of ART no longer worked due to years of use, needed second- or third-line drugs.“However, these new medicines are expensive and not easily available in the governmentrun programme. The poor cannot afford to buy them,” the doctor added. However, city authorities in charge of the HIV/AIDS control programme said there is a simple explanation for the increase: A sharper public health programme that has managed to track more patients.Dr Shrikala Acharya of the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) said the organization had carried out intensive loss-to-follow-up drives as per central government directives to track patients who were lost to follow-up. “This drive helped us update the actual number of deaths. It could also be the reason for the increase in reported deaths,” she said, adding that the rise isn’t necessarily an actual increase in the number of deaths.Incidentally, the HMIS data shows that the number of AIDS deaths has been steadily decreasing across Maharashtra. From 1,426 deaths in 2015-16, the figure fell to 1,390 in the following year and further to 1,327 in 2017-18. A doctor said that HIV care has improved so much that very few deaths are recorded in the private sector, where patients pay for the latest medicine and get updated care.","['jump', 'increase', 'programme', 'doctor', 'hivaids', 'hiv', 'health', 'mumbai', 'patients', 'number', 'aids', 'ministry', '62', 'deaths']","MUMBAI: Deaths due to AIDS (acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome) have increased significantly in the city over the last three years, according to data available with the central health ministry’s Health Management Information System .

Under the policy, anyone diagnosed as an HIV+ patient is put on antiretroviral therapy (ART), irrespective of the clinical stage or CD4 count—a snapshot of how the patient’s immune system is functioning. In the past, ART, which suppresses the activity of the HIV retrovirus, was recommended only in cases where it was considered necessary.Since the implementation of the ‘test and treat’ policy, more than 370 HIV+ persons have been put on ART in a phased manner in the state.“ART, which can slow down the rate at which HIV weakens the immune system, is now administered to everybody: Men, women, adolescents and children,” Parab said, pointing out that the move is expected to keep their immune system strong and healthy and improve their longevity and quality of life.Parab said the elimination of stigma is vital to ensure that people who have the slightest doubt of their status voluntarily come forward to get tested and seek treatment. “Those indulging in risky behaviour must also protect themselves, as HIV is 100% preventable,” he added.","['system', 'trimester', '2018s', 'immune', 'person', 'policy', 'treat', 'cases', 'detected', 'number', 'transmission', 'reported', 'day', 'art', 'hiv']","PANAJI: Ninety-two people tested positive for the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) in Goa in the first three months of 2018, translating into one case being detected each day.

Preventing the infection is very important, but there is no vaccine available yet.Researchers found that levels of Treg lymphocytes were higher in the blood of newborn babies born to mothers with HIV infection who had escaped the infection themselves, compared with babies who were born with HIV infection.Lymphocytes are cells of the immune system that protect the body by fighting bacteria and viruses. Treg cells, or regulatory T cells, are an important ""self-check"" in the immune system to prevent excessive immune reactions that could lead to tissue damage.The researchers examined the blood of 64 babies who were born HIV-uninfected and 28 babies born HIV-infected and found that Treg cell levels were higher in uninfected babies at the time of birth. In contrast, other lymphocyte types were activated and higher in HIV-infected infants. The HIV virus can only infect cells that are activated, so Treg may protect from HIV infection by suppressing activation of other lymphocytes.They analyzed the stored blood by flow cytometry, a technique that can differentiate between the different types of cells based on what markers they express on their surface. Regulatory T cells come in many forms with the most well-understood being those that express the markers CD4, CD25, and FOXP3.""Even though the number of babies studied is relatively small, these findings indicate that Treg, by controlling immune activation, may lower the vulnerability of the babies to HIV or other chronic infections even before they are born,"" said Kessler.These results could pave the way for the development of vaccines or other immune-based therapies that could be used together with medications to prevent the spread of HIV or other infections from mothers to their babies.","['infection', 'immune', 'babies', 'vaccine', 'regulatory', 'comes', 'mothers', 'born', 'important', 'cells', 'treg', 'reality', 'closer', 'hiv']","WASHINGTON DC: HIV vaccine could soon be a reality.Researchers have found that Treg cells, a type of regulatory lymphocyte, might be protecting babies in the womb from getting infected with the HIV virus when the mother is infected.

KOLKATA: Cafe Positive, a dream of 10 HIV-positive teenagers, has finally found an address.The 12ft-by-10ft garage at Jodhpur Park was finalised after a six-month search for space in some of south Kolkata’s posh localities yielded a straightaway “no” from house-owners when they learnt about who will manage and run the shop.At 524 Jodhpur Park, a senior official of a leading national ayurvedic firm and an honorary member of Rotary Club of Calcutta has offered his garage space to the teenagers from where they plan to start the café in July. “I was initially a bit hesitant to offer my garage space as it is much smaller than what they were looking for. But after learning that they had failed to manage any space in over six months, I told them to start their business from here. This can be the beginning from where they can spread their wings. I am happy to be a part of this noble initiative,” said Indrajyoti Dasgupta.Dasgupta, who has moved his car out of the garage for the café, is yet to find an alternate parking space.TOI had reported on March 5 how six boys and four girls, who have undergone training in baking, sandwich-making and coffee and mocktail preparations, aspired to start their own coffee shop at some location in south Kolkata but were turned down by house-owners.“We faced strange reasons from people for refusing space to these kids. While some said their family members were not ready, others said people in the neighbourhood wouldn’t allow them to run a business with HIV-positive patients. But we are thankful to have finally found space. It is a much smaller space than what we were looking for, but at least the kids can start from here,” said Kallol Ghosh, founder of Anandaghar, a shelter for abandoned HIV/AIDS-infected children at Narendrapur.N GO Anandaghar will give the initial funds and later hand over the management of the café to the 10 youths, who would be running it.The café is scheduled to start from July 14, coinciding with Rath Yatra. “We will begin with an assortment of hot and cold coffees, mocktails and mojitos, and at least four types of cakes, veg and non-veg sandwiches and cookies. For now, we will bank more on takeaway service till we get a bigger place with a larger seating capacity,” said Susanta Pal (name changed), one of the 10 youths.“It has been a long wait. At one time, we thought we would never get space for our shop after being rejected by several house-owners.

We will be able to wipe off the taboos associated with the disease we suffer from with day-to-day interaction with our customers,” said Sathi Biswas (name changed), another member.","['space', 'garage', 'signals', 'finally', 'start', 'dream', 'café', 'teenagers', 'looking', 'smaller', 'househunt', 'south', 'kids', 'end', 'hiv']","Congratulations are in order for the property owners who have risen above such evidently widespread — but completely unfounded — prejudice.

The pellets, that can be sprinkled over food too, have already proven to be advantageous, in terms of administration. The syrup , which used to be the main alternative for paediatric patients, was met with a lot of resistance as it left a bitter aftertaste and children would often spit it out.The centre at Sion hospital will be documenting the efficacy and acceptance of the oral pellets, along with the other centres. “So far, the response has been positive. Earlier, parents would return with the syrup bottles and say it was unpalatable,” said Dr Yashwant Gabhale, head of the paediatric centre at Sion. Additionally, a decrease in side-effects has also been seen. “Problems such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been minimal, so far,” he added.There are nearly 76,000 children living with HIV in the country of which 5,000-odd are from Maharashtra. The use of oral pellets has been restricted to children up to two years of age for now. While the national programme incorporated children since 2006, it was only by late 2007 that paediatric formulations were available. Former paediatric head of Sion hospital Dr Mamata Manglani said that children were initially given adult medication till syrups came into the national programme. “However, there were logistical and storage issues with syrups that paved the way for dispensable tablets over time,” she said.Finding pharmaceutical companies to make child-friendly formulations has always been a challenge, say NACO experts, who hope to scale up once the paediatric centres present their feedback and there are more suppliers. “Currently, Cipla is the only company that is making oral pellet formulation. Mylan is likely to start producing it next,” said NACO’s Dr RS Gupta. He said the introduction of pellets is likely to make a big difference in adherence. “Gulping pills every day is a struggle in itself. It becomes more difficult for babies,” he said. Doctors say the overall adherence among children is more than 90%, till their parents are giving them the medicines.A parent TOI spoke to said oral pellets are undoubtedly easy to administer. “We only hope that it is regularly available and the supply is uninterrupted since there are limited manufacturers,” he said. Not too long ago, the syrup was in short supply across the country.","['hospital', 'say', 'hiv', 'syrup', 'dr', 'pellets', 'paediatric', 'national', 'kids', 'children', 'palatable', 'sion', 'oral']","The pellets, that can be sprinkled over food too, have already proven to be advantageous, in terms of administration.

It also noted that the epidemics were expanding in Pakistan and the Philippines.In India, new HIV infections dropped from 120,000 in 2010 to 88,000 in 2017, AIDS-related deaths from 160,000 to 69,000 and people living with HIV from 2,300,000 to 2,100,000 in the same time period, the report said.India has an approved social protection strategy, policy or framework that is being implemented, it said.Successive surveys in Cambodia, India, Thailand and Vietnam also indicate that attitudes towards people living with HIV have improved creating safer working conditions for sex workers and engaging them closely in the design and implementation of programmes make a huge difference, it said.The report underscored the public health benefits of decriminalising sex work.It found that countries that had decriminalised at least some aspects of sex work have fewer sex workers living with HIV than countries that criminalise all aspects of sex work.Modelling based on data from Canada, India and Kenya indicates that the decriminalisation of sex work could avert 33-46 per cent of HIV infections over the course of a decade.The report cited the example of Karnataka, where advocacy work with senior police officials, sensitisation workshops and the inclusion of HIV and human rights topics in pre-service curricula led to significant decreases in the arrest of female sex workers, especially during police raids.Before the interventions, half (50 per cent) of the 4,110 surveyed female sex workers said they had been arrested or detained at some point during police raids, that proportion shrank to 20 per cent after the interventions, the report said.Referring to the initiative sponsored by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to reduce the spread of HIV in India, the report said the Avahan programme in Karnataka and other States remained a ""sterling example"" of the impact of combining condom programming with community empowerment and structural improvements that tackle stigma, violence and unsafe working environments.UNAIDS, however, issued a stark wake-up call for nations, warning that the global response to HIV is at a precarious point.At the halfway point to the 2020 targets, the report warned that the pace of progress was not matching global ambition.""We are sounding the alarm"", said Michel Sidibe, Executive Director of UNAIDS.""Entire regions are falling behind, the huge gains we made for children are not being sustained, women are still most affected, resources are still not matching political commitments and key populations continue to be ignored.

She, however, didn’t become a victim of HIV . Fighting stigma, she groomed her self-confidence and started saving for her sons’ education. Today, her elder son, an MTech holder, works in Hyderabad, while her younger son is pursuing undergraduate engineering.Like Aishwarya, thousands of sex workers and sexual minorities have successfully kept HIV at bay and changed their lives drastically, thanks to project Avahan . The initiative focuses on integrating biological and behavioural aspects of target groups and empowering them with peer education.Avahan has been described as a “sterling example” in the recent report released by the joint UN Agency on AIDS ( UNAIDS ). Between 2003-12, the project, funded by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and University of Manitoba in Canada, reached out to 65,000 sex workers and over 25,000 sexual minorities. As per a survey, the findings of which were reported in British Medical Journal, the prevalence of HIV in Karnataka reduced from 19.6% to 10.8% and of syphilis (another sexually transmitted disease ) from 5.9% to 2.4%, with the increased use of condoms. Avahan, which targeted 16 districts of Karnataka, was credited for the achievement.“We got an identity. We ensured that we protected ourselves even while in the job. I am now into counselling and am leading a better life. I was able to save money for my children’s education,” said Aishwarya, who is no longer in sex work.What made Avahan a successful model was that it never took a moral and judgemental view, says H L Mohan, managing trustee, Karnataka Health Promotion Trust (KHPT), who spearheaded the project.According to a Lancet report, Avahan prevented no less than six lakh HIV cases in India. Karnataka was one of the six states chosen for the project, and here, it was executed by KHPT from 2003 to 2012.The programme not only brought in mandatory condom usage but also worked for the community members’ empowerment. Clinics were set up where members went for fortnightly tests. The project also helped them save money in cooperative societies run by themselves. Drop-in centres were established at the hotspots, where sex workers could walk in at any time to relax, watch TV and consult doctors. In Bengaluru, the centres were set up in Yeshwantpur, Shivajinagar and Malleswaram and were functional 24/7.With every fortnightly visit, members of the vulnerable section understood the complexity of the situation they were in. “We set up cooperative societies run by sex workers, so that they can save money and don’t have to borrow from money lenders. We have even saved many young girls from being trafficked,” said Mohan.In 2013, when the project ended, the centres were subsumed with the government. “Avahan should have been an ongoing project to make the state HIV-free,” added Mohan. Even now, KHPT gets visitors from abroad who come to study the model that led to HIV prevention.No mean featTo win the confidence of sex workers and work with them in risk-reduction interventions wasn’t easy to begin with. Usage of condoms alone wouldn’t have worked unless we reduced their vulnerability. We had to closely work with them to understand the strategy to safeguard them from infections. We did a hotspot mapping involving them. The strategy was different for each district. While home-based prostitution was seen more in districts like Shivamogga, street-based work was more prevalent in places like Davanagere, Ballari and BengaluruH L Mohan, managing trustee, KHPT","['sex', 'money', 'reduced', 'sterling', 'example', 'avahan', 'workers', 'karnatakas', 'karnataka', 'work', 'khpt', 'set', 'termed', 'project', 'burden', 'agency', 'hiv']","Today, her elder son, an MTech holder, works in Hyderabad, while her younger son is pursuing undergraduate engineering.Like Aishwarya, thousands of sex workers and sexual minorities have successfully kept HIV at bay and changed their lives drastically, thanks to project Avahan .

Every once a month, the person must seek leave from the workplace, arrive early in the morning to a hospital, beat the crowds and queue up for hours to collect the antiretroviral medicines.For a section of people living with HIV, this situation will soon change. In a first, the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) has decided to give patients the medicine stock for 90-days at a time. Currently, most patients are handed stocks for a month, and in rare instances, for two months. People living with HIV have long wanted this option, which has been tried with success in several African countries.Termed as Differentiated Service Delivery Model (DSDM), it has already been rolled out at ten centres across the country, including KEM Hospital in Parel. Patients, though, will have to meet several criteria to be eligible for DSDM. “Primarily, it will be given to those who have been on treatment for at least a year and have 95% adherence rate. The individual has to be clinically fit and free of any side-effects and opportunistic infections (such as tuberculosis) at the time of enrolment,” said Dr RS Gupta, deputy director, NACO. “Besides making it easier for patients, it will also help to decongest the ART centres,” he added.At KEM, over 500 patients have already been identified and enrolled into the programme. The Parel hospital caters to over 1500 people living with HIV. “Patients often have problems seeking frequent leaves from their workplace. This initiative will save them repeated visits only for drug refill. It will also save travel costs,” said Dr Srikala Acharya, assistant project director at the Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS). She added that only patients on the first line of treatment and CD4 count (a vital parameter) of more than 500 will be considered for DSDM.Besides Mumbai’s KEM, centres at Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Benaras, and designated hospitals in Manipur, Bhagalpur and Raipur are rolling out the initiative. Talking to TOI, a person living with HIV hailed the model and said it was long-awaited and will go a long way in making life easy for patients. “Most HIV-affected people continue to live in anonymity. It, therefore, becomes difficult to explain in offices why one needs to leave every month on fixed days,” said the 42-year-old central Mumbai resident.Members of the civil society too have welcomed the decision but cautioned that support systems have to be strengthened for the model to succeed. “It’s a great initiative particularly for patients who have to visit resource-strapped health facilities. In Mumbai, 17 ART centres cater to nearly 35000 patients. Decongestion of these centres will allow counsellors to spend more time with patients,” said HIV activist Ganesh Acharya. However, he said for DSDM to succeed, counselling facilities must be enhanced.Echoing the same, Sachin Awasthi from Vihaan, a patients’ group that works towards improving adherence, said that the monthly meeting with counsellors and caregivers play an important role. “We have to ensure that patients don’t start taking their regimes casually,” he said.","['hospital', 'relief', 'model', 'initiative', 'patients', 'mumbai', 'living', 'centres', 'kem', 'months', 'drugs', 'month', 'hiv']","MUMBAI: For people living with HIV , receiving medicines is as much of a challenge as keeping the virus in check.

This single insensitive act by the state’s premier hospital will only serve to dissuade others from seeking treatment. Under the central law that provides for stiff punishment against all actions that may lead to hostility against HIV patients, both, the person who ordered the placing of the board on the patient’s bed and implementor, must be punished. Also, the state government must immediately see to it that all staffers of GMC, medical and otherwise, are apprised about the proper ethics to be followed in treating HIV patients and the consequences in case of failure to do so.

PANAJI: In a blatant violation of confidentiality over the status of an HIV positive patient, Goa Medical College on Tuesday afternoon affixed a ‘Universal Precaution’ board on the patient’s bed, causing much distress to the family besides casting stigma.The board invited curious stares and subjected the family to humiliating questions. No sooner they found out about the board, the patient’s children decided not to dare enter the ward for fear of being discriminated at the educational institutions where they study. Other members of the family were in tears trying to fend off unwanted questions.“The doctors, nurses, attendants and even those who bring food and clean the patient know about the health status. It is clearly written in all the papers appended in the treatment file too. I can’t understand why this board was put,” a close relative of the patient said.“The hospital should be helping such people who may not live for long. If they did not want us here, then they should have given us a special room or sent us away,” she said. The patient has been admitted at GMC in the past but this is the first time the family says such a board was affixed.“The staff did not think about the repercussions on the family. The ward sister was actually fixing the board near the patient’s head, but later put it at the foot of the bed. Were instructions given by the doctor to put the board? When the other patients ask the nurses about the board, won’t they reveal the health status?” she asked.“Even the few people who are coming to visit the patient will stop once they come to know about the health status. Neighbours are also coming to visit and are asking about the board. It’s a big shame for us. I’m going mad,” she said.The board was removed on Tuesday evening after a non-governmental organisation, Human Touch, working to end discrimination and provide care and support to people living with HIV raised the issue with the hospital authorities.Dean of Goa Medical College Dr Pradeep Naik said circulars were issued in the past asking the staff members to avoid any such terminology.“We have given strict instructions to all wards not to engage in any discriminatory behaviour against patients. From the preliminary report which I have received, it is not clear who put up the board. I have sought a detailed report by Wednesday. We will repeat the circular that we had issued earlier. This will never happen again,” he told TOI.“Universal precautions are necessary, but should not be displayed publicly on the patient’s bed,” CEO of Human Touch Foundation Peter Borges said.“This is not an isolated case. Such incidents will lead to more stigma and discrimination for those living with HIV. Such attitude of those working in medical space is unbecoming and will create hardships for those trying to access healthcare services in public hospitals. We will never be able to end the stigma if it exists in medical settings,” Borges said.","['reveals', 'man', 'gmc', 'kin', 'board', 'hospital', 'status', 'trauma', 'health', 'family', 'patients', 'patient', 'bed', 'identity', 'medical', 'hiv']","This single insensitive act by the state’s premier hospital will only serve to dissuade others from seeking treatment.

The HIV-positive girl is hearing impaired and her mental ability is that of a child half her age. Like her, at least 60% of the 110 inmates at Solapur’s Palawi-Prabha Hira Pratishthan, the state’s oldest institution caring for children with HIV , suffer from varying degrees of hearing loss . TOI found that the prevalence of height and weight stunting is more than 70%, while over 30% have stymied mental development.AIDS-related deaths may have dropped by 54% in India over a decade, but most children in rural areas living on antiretroviral therapy (ART) are barely surviving, afflicted by physical and mental deficiencies. The reason: the national programme focuses on medicines instead of a comprehensive medical, nutritional and psychosocial model. For the nearly three lakh registered HIV patients in the state, there are less than 1,000 counsellors, mostly underpaid, and overburdened with administrative work. A fourth of India’s 60,000-odd children taking ART for HIV live in Maharashtra . With no adequate support, the state recently learned that over 30,000 of the two lakh patients on treatment have quietly dropped out.Sumana looks like a 10-year-old though she’s a teenager 11 months shy of 18. Four feet tall and with body weight of 30kg, she is at least 25kg underweight and significantly short for her age. Her mental ability is of a child half her age and she is hearing impaired.At Solapur’s Palawi-Prabha Hira Pratishthan, one of Maharashtra’s oldest institutions caring for children living with HIV, cases like Sumana’s are not an exception. At least 60% of the 110 children here suffer from varying degrees of hearing loss. The prevalence of height and weight stunting is more than 70%, while over a third have stymied mental development. Besides physical, prevalence of mental health problems such as depression is alarmingly high.AIDS-related deaths have dropped by 54% and new infections by 66% in India over a decade, but children like Sumana are a testimony to the gaping deficit in the national programme that focuses on drugs instead of a holistic medical, nutritional and psychosocial model that a complex disease such as HIV warrants. A little over a quarter of the 60,000 such children are in Maharashtra.An otherwise spirited child, Sumant gets drowsy and irritable after taking medicines. “I get severe stomach-ache, dizziness, headache and diarrhoea,'' he says, describing his plight after taking the daily dose of antiretroviral therapy (ART) medicines. Born with the virus, these children need to take two to six capsules daily. For additional infections such as tuberculosis, the pill count could run into double digits. Their very survival depends on following this regimen, but the six-year-old Sumant is among 17 children at the Palawi home who refuse to continue with ART .“Children go through hell in spite of ART. There is no denying the dramatic shift in HIV care today, but what about those who got the disease at the turn of the century and have spent a lifetime taking medicines. We know little or nothing about what the virus or ART does to each child?” said Palawi's founder, 65-year-old Mangaltai Shah. She says most children in Palawi grapple with problems ranging from skin rashes, oral and vaginal yeast infections, pus accumulation in ears, hearing and vision problems to life-threatening infections such as TB. “So when medicines meant to heal start giving additional trouble, they find it easier to discard.” Moreover, she adds, at Rs 25 per child per day institutions like Palawi neither have adequate funds nor support from government hospitals to tackle the unique health problems of each child.Sumant is supposed to receive intensive counselling from the local ART centre till his adherence improves, but Shah says the three doctors and four counsellors that cater to 300 HIV patients daily at Solapur Civil Hospital barely have the time to look up. For nearly 3 lakh registered HIV patients in the state, there are less than 1,000 counsellors. Another Palawi resident, four-year-old Khusboo, suffered hearing loss after recurrent ear infections. The diagnosis didn't come from the ART centre, but from her teacher at Palawi’s in-house Gyan Mandir school, who noticed Khusboo was oblivious to classroom activities.The institution was compelled to start its own school in 2014—a ground-plus-one structure next to the orphanage on Pandharpur’s outskirts—as children are denied admission in regular schools the moment Palawi is mentioned. But it’s a blessing in disguise for these children who struggle to sit through more than one or two classes without dozing off. “A regular school wouldn’t understand or probably tolerate it,” Patil says. Palawi which has been home to 250 HIV-positive children since 2001, has lost 40 to the disease. AIDS claims an average of 2,500 lives in Maharashtra annually; how many are children is not known. The state recently discovered that over 30,000 of the two lakh patients on treatment have dropped out. Here too, paediatric percentage is unclear. On paper, 16,000 children in Maharashtra are on treatment.Coping is equally challenging for children in the community, who having lost one or both parents to the virus, face vulnerabilities starting from poor access to healthcare and government entitlements to education and nutrition.Now 17, Palghar native Sachin has been on ART since he was three. He lost his mother at birth and father last December to HIV. He admits to skipping his daily 10-pill regimen. He dropped out of school due to his condition. “The pain would begin after the morning pills. I would cry in class and be compelled to lie down,” said Sachin who can't keep a job either as the medicines make him “drowsy and tired”. At four-feet and grossly underweight at 35kg, Sachin typifies the wasting and stunting associated with HIV.HIV is a neurotropic virus that not just attacks the immune system but practically affects every organ, resulting in damage to nerve tissues, cognitive development, physical growth, and at the same time causing learning difficulties, speech and language problems. Experts say it’s crucial to monitor toxicity and provide 360-degree healthcare. Dr Ira Shah, an expert in paediatric HIV, says it’s not enough to tell children to take medicines lifelong. “These are toxic drugs given at a much younger age. It is necessary to monitor bone health or metabolic acidosis before the children become intolerant,” she said. In one of her published papers, she wrote about three children who died of neurological complications caused by HIV despite their viral load being suppressed with drugs.National Aids Control Organisation deputy director Dr R S Gupta admits little is known about how children cope with ART. But he underlines the fact that “they live longer because of the medicines and the average life expectancy now exceeds 20.” There are side-effects, but “what is important is they are alive”. Ironically, Sumant, Khusboo, Sachin are Indian HIV programme's success stories even though they are not thriving but merely surviving.(Names of all patients have been changed)","['palawi', 'battle', 'maharashtras', 'mental', 'infections', 'children', 'problems', 'despite', 'patients', 'hearing', 'fight', 'kids', 'crippling', 'medicines', 'meds', 'art', 'hiv']","For the nearly three lakh registered HIV patients in the state, there are less than 1,000 counsellors, mostly underpaid, and overburdened with administrative work.

Failure to detect and treat HIV early may not just cause irreversible neurological damages , but also prove fatal for babies.Doctors at the civic-run BYL Nair Hospital recently discovered the worrying trend while analyzing data of 1,410 babies who were tested for HIV between 2015 and 2018 at the reference laboratory in Kasturba Hospital. At six weeks of birth, infants born to HIV-infected mothers are subjected to the first test, which if positive, is repeated immediately. This second test assumes great significance as the child is immediately started on antiretroviral therapy (ART), if this report too comes positive.The study showed that merely 61% of parents returned for the second confirmatory test. “We were surprised to see that so many parents are missing out on the second visit, thereby delaying the child’s treatment,” said Dr Jayanthi Shastri, who heads the molecular lab at Kasturba that receives samples from 36 HIV testing and counselling centres across the city. The laboratory also gets dried blood spot samples from Gujarat, Goa and Madhya Pradesh. “Such a delay is unfortunate as the advances in ART assure that children with HIV escape the serious neurological damages,” she said.Nair hospital’s Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre has found migration to be one of the biggest reasons. “In 70% of these cases, parents are migrants, who come here for child delivery and return to their hometowns. In a small percentage, it’s also the lack of understanding about the seriousness of HIV,” said Medha Deorukhkar, a counsellor at the centre. Around 46% of children were lost to follow-up, the analysis found.The national protocol warrants that babies be followed up to 18 months as antibodies from mother could give out false positivity in tests carried out before that. In fact, regular follow-ups and counselling are crucial not just for HIV-positive babies, but also for negative ones. While India data is scarce, it has been found that babies who have escaped contracting the virus during birth may still get it through breastfeeding. “Counselling is crucial as mothers may not comprehend the harm of switching between breast milk to formula milk,” said a doctor from Sion hospital’s paediatric centre of excellence for HIV. “Bottle feeds cause ulceration on the gut wall, which makes it conducive for the virus to enter the baby’s bloodstream.”Dr Shikala Acharya, assistant project director at Mumbai District Aids Control Society, said while mother-to-child transmission has dropped to less than 0.2%, tracking remains a challenge. In 2017-18, of around 460 deliveries in HIV-positive women, four babies tested positive. She said in families where the couple has not informed extended family, pursuing them to return for testing of the child becomes difficult.But Dr Anju Seth, director of paediatrics at Delhi’s Lady Hardinge Medical College, said it’s worth the effort as virus suppression is crucial here. “The first three years of a child’s life is when maximum growth happens. If the virus is not controlled, damages like stunting of height, weight and developmental milestones could be permanent.”","['treatment', 'babies', 'test', 'testing', 'counselling', 'study', 'return', 'newborns', 'parents', 'timely', 'second', 'virus', 'miss', 'hivpositive', 'hiv']","MUMBAI: Four out of 10 HIV-positive newborns in the city could be missing out on timely treatment as their parents fail to return for a confirmatory diagnosis .

It has also adopted ""test and treat"" policy which means any person testing positive will be entitled for free treatment by the state and central government. Earlier, this was restricted by a CD4 count rate.* It also provides for confidentiality of HIV-related information and makes it necessary to get informed consent for undertaking HIV tests, medical treatment and research.* The law makes it mandatory for state governments to appoint an Ombudsman to inquire into complaints related to the violation of the Act and the provision of health care services.* If a person or an institution fails to comply with any order given by the Ombudsman within the stipulated period of time, they could be fined a maximum of Rs 10,000. A continuous failure could lead to an additional fine of up to Rs 5000 every day until the they comply.* The new legislation has provisions to safeguard the property rights of HIV positive people. Every HIV infected person below the age of 18 years has the right to reside in a shared household and enjoy the facilities of the household.* The Bill was initially introduced in Parliament by the UPA government, the amendments to the HIV and AIDS (Prevention and Control) Bill, 2014 were revived by the Narendra Modi government in July last year.* The total number of people living with HIV in India is estimated at 21.17 lakhs, whereas around 86000 new HIV infections were reported in 2015, showing 66% decline in new infections from 2000.

They claim the revelation turned their lives upside down, causing them mental agony and pushing them into depression.Halappa KB, 60, and Sushmitha, 21, are residents of Davanagere. Halappa, a labourer, got admitted to City Central Hospital in December 2017 for acute leg pain, followed by blockage in his veins. He alleged that no consent was taken from him for the HIV test nor was he informed while his blood was being drawn. His son Raju H is now running from pillar to post seeking justice and has complained to the consumer court as well, claiming that his father had to face stigma due to the false positive reports.“The hospital conducted an HIV test without our knowledge and consent. It claimed that the report was positive and refused to conduct cardiac surgery on my father. He slipped into depression and even attempted suicide. We brought him to a private hospital in Bengaluru and got him tested for HIV. But the report was negative and he even underwent the operation. My complaint to the health department has been ignored and justice has been delayed,” Raju told TOI.Sushmitha had visited the Davanagere hospital in March for a prenatal check-up when she was five months pregnant. “The blood test was done on March 23. But they asked us to collect the report after three days. We were shocked with the findings — they showed she was HIV-positive — and underwent stress and psychological trauma,” said her husband Prahlad S, a police constable.The couple then went to the government-run Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre for HIV testing. Till then, they had no idea that the report issued by the private hospital was false. “ICTC’s report revealed Sushmitha was not HIV-positive, which came as a huge relief. But the private hospital was firm on its stand. If they had a doubt, they should have conducted another test,” said Prahlad. Sushmitha’s medical negligence complaint with the health department is pending inquiry. Prahlad added that the hospital didn’t even bother to counsel them when they were traumatised after seeing the report.Dr Raghavan GD, district HIV/AIDS control officer, Davanagere, said he was asked by the district health officer to inquire into both the complaints. “In Halappa’s case, the inquiry report has been submitted to the government, but the findings can’t be disclosed. In the other case, the inquiry is yet to begin,” he said.When TOI contacted the hospital authorities, they refused to comment but neither denied nor admitted to the allegations. “The cases are pending before the consumer court. At this stage, we can’t comment on the complaints. We have cooperated with the health department for the inquiry,” said Padmanabh UR, administrator, City Central Hospital.In 2017, the state witnessed a series of protests by doctors when the government initiated amendments to the Karnataka Private Medical Establishment (KPME) Act to regulate private medical establishments. Though the amendments were made, they were called the watered-down version of those intended. In the two cases, the patients have sought action under the KPME Act. “But the Act authorises us only to check and take measures if a hospital/clinic is functioning without registration. Medical negligence cases don’t come under it,” said Dr Raghavan GD, district HIV/AIDS control officer, Davanagere.","['hospital', 'false', 'issued', 'test', 'davanagere', 'file', 'report', 'health', 'plaints', 'department', 'patients', 'reports', 'inquiry', 'medical', 'allege', 'private', 'hivpositive', 'hiv']","BENGALURU: A labourer and a homemaker have filed separate complaints with the health department against a Davanagere private hospital for allegedly giving them false HIV-positive reports .

The results, published Thursday in the Lancet HIV medical journal, may pave the way for other states and countries to stop transmission of the virus with the use of a treatment called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP.""The speed of the decline we’ve seen in new HIV infections in gay and bisexual men is a world first,"" said study leader Andrew Grulich, head of HIV epidemiology and prevention at the Kirby Institute of the University of New South Wales.

While the study results can’t be generalized to indicate similar efficacy in heterosexual populations, they do demonstrate that PrEP is ""highly cost-effective"" in certain high-risk groups, Grulich said in a phone interview.New HIV infections occurred in 102 gay and bisexual men in the state of New South Wales in the first year after the study began, compared with 149 infections in the 12 months prior.""While we’ve known for at least three or four years now of individual-level efficacy of PrEP, there has been some reticence around the world by policy makers to properly fund the roll out of PrEP because the population impact hasn’t been shown -- and that’s what we set out to do,"" Grulich said.There were about 180,000 people in the US taking Truvada for PrEP at the end of June, Robin L.

She alleged that her husband had injected her with infected blood while administrating saline when she was unwell in March last year.”The woman said she underwent clinical tests when her condition deteriorated. “The woman stated in her complaint that she did not have physical relationships with anyone other than her husband,” Mane said.He said the police were yet to investigate if the husband was responsible for administering the HIV-infected blood into her body. “Based on her complaint, we have booked her husband and sent her blood samples to a laboratory,” Mane said.Infectious disease expert Bharat Purandare said, “It is possible to transmit HIV either through an infected needle or by giving transfusion of infected blood. If the woman knows whose infected needle or blood was used to transmit the virus, a DNA test can be carried out on her and the HIV-affected person to establish the link.”The woman stated in her complaint after her marriage in 2015, her husband and in-laws started harassing her for money to start a business. “The woman’s father used to give in to their demands.

In the last five years, over 6,300 women were detected with the virus during pregnancy, underlining the urgent need to reach out to people who may be living with the virus but are unaware of their status.This World AIDS Day, as there is a global clamour for expansion of HIV-testing and treatment under the theme of ‘Know your status’, activists demanded that government agencies must push facilities deeper into the community.Dr Ashok Anand, who heads the gynaecology department at JJ Hospital, that carries out a massive volume of HIV positive childbirths, said even today, hundreds of women find out their status only during their pregnancy.“Most women get the infection from husbands. In fact, many husbands know about their HIV status only when their wives are pregnant,” said Dr Anand. Data from Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) shows that 92% of infections are due to unsafe sex, a significant percentage of which is among heterosexual couples. The remaining are caused by transfusion with infected blood, use of infected needles or from mother to child. Dr Anand said prevention was better as always, as an infected mother also stands the risk of passing on the virus to the child.While with multiple-drug regimen the incidence of mother-to-child transmission has reduced a great deal, some babies continue to get the infection from mothers. Since 2014-15, nearly 300 babies have got HIV infection from mothers in the state. Activist Ganesh Acharya said it was time to remodel targeted interventions and penetrate communities deeper. “We need more behaviour change communication to encourage more to get tested,” he said, adding that people still getting HIV in large numbers suggest that programmes may be failing.Maharashtra State Aids Control Organisation (MDACS) officials said a decade ago more than 4,000 pregnant women tested positive every year. “The number of women testing positive declined by 85% over 10 years, even as women being screened more than doubled,” said a senior official. He said from nearly 8 lakh in 2008, over 21 lakh pregnant women were now being screened annually in Maharashtra.MDACS assistant project director Dr Shrikala Acharya said to facilitate testing BMC has tied up with 113 outlets of Metropolis where HIV test will be carried out for Rs75 for a week from December 1.","['infection', 'women', 'status', 'hiv', 'pregnant', 'testing', 'state', 'positive', '600', 'tested', 'infected', 'virus', 'dips']","MUMBAI: Despite significant progress in containing the spread of HIV among the general population, over 600 pregnant women have tested positive for the virus in the state this year.

He was a nice guy with a good heart and he made me laugh. Our conversations soon progressed from chai breaks during lectures to late night calls. We both knew that we were inching towards a proper relationship, but before it was too late to turn back, I had to tell him the truth about myself.The same truth I had kept to myself for so long with no intentions to ever bring up again. But here he was and if anything, he deserved the truth.I was 19 when I started feeling feverish and exhausted all the time. We ran many tests but everything was ruled out. Soon enough, I started feeling severe swelling and pain in my lymph nodes, especially the back of my neck. My body started aching and it started to hurt a lot everywhere. Completely clueless, the doctors kept giving me painkillers and antibioticsAfter three weeks, I met a doctor that informed me that I had contracted the human immunodeficiency virus or HIV. I stood rooted to the ground, while he tried to comfort me saying he would prescribe me some medicines which will help in suppressing the virus.I was devastated to put it simply. I thought being diagnosed with HIV meant that my life was over and I had AIDS. The doctor told me that AIDS was the most serious complication of HIV diseases.The bottom line was HIV was incurable and if left untreated it could go on reducing my T cells. The same cells which fight infection, hence rendering me helplessStrangely, the first person I thought about was Viraat. I had to tell him about everything before things went any further. So, mustering up all the courage in the world, I took a deep breath and said, “Viraat, I have HIV .” In all honesty, I did know how I was expecting him to react. The silence felt like ages and he finally spoke, “I have a lot of questions.”He took a long pause and asked me a lot of questions, the primary one being how well I was taking care of myself and what should he be doing to make my life easier. His genuine concern and warmth seeped through his words. He did not judge me or asked me any questions like where did I contract it from. He was patient and calm and it was pretty much the best reaction I had ever gotten from anyone.Fast-forward 5 years later, Viraat and I are happily married! Obviously, we go for regular check-ups and I have asked my doctor what all can be done to prevent Viraat from getting that virus, apart from protection. The doctor asked him to take a Pre-exposure prophylaxis (or PrEP) pill.

A total of 1,760 people were covered in the drive including 1,195 from the Trichy central prison and special prison for women and 565 people from orphanages, rescue and rehabilitation shelters and old-age homes, that were zeroed in for the programme.Deputy director of medical services, TB control, Dr S Savithri told TOI that all people with symptoms of tuberculosis were tested during the programme. A total of 115 sputum samples were collected. “We utilised this opportunity to cover the vulnerable groups and no one tested positive for TB. Early intervention is an absolute must for efficient treatment of TB,” she said.Though there were no new TB cases at the prisons, there were a handful of existing TB patients and they were being provided treatment. No existing TB cases were reported in other closed settings and state-run homes.While less prevalence of TB among people detected recently might seem to be positive news, according to health officials, prevalence is still high in Trichy city, Manachanallur, Thuvakudi and Thiruverumbur. So far, this year around 2,800 people were said to have received treatment for treatment in the whole district.On the other hand, all adults among the covered population were made to undergo the HIV/AIDS test. “Unlike TB, HIV/ AIDS does not show early symptoms. In some cases, it may take seven to ten years for symptoms to show. That’s why all the adults were tested,” District Aids Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU), S Martin Manivannan said. Though there were no new cases, around seven to 10 HIV/ AIDS patients were inmates at the prisons and none in the other closed settings.Manivannan said that no positive HIV/ AIDS cases was evidence for how much the disease has decreased in Trichy. “Compared to the prevalence rate of 1.91% in 2011, the prevalence is just 0.37% now. Detection drives like the recent ones show how much AIDS has been curbed in the district,” he said.","['prevalence', 'vulnerable', 'treatment', 'prisons', 'cases', 'detection', 'sections', 'dip', 'aids', 'tb', 'trichy', 'hiv']","“We utilised this opportunity to cover the vulnerable groups and no one tested positive for TB.

Unable to convince them, the authorities are now draining the water from the 36-acre lake — roughly the size of 25 football fields — which they hope to refill with water from the Malaprabha canal. The Morab lake is the biggest in Navalgund taluk and the only source of drinking water for villagers and cattle. As of now, villagers trek 2-3km to the Malaprabha canal to fetch water.“This is unfortunate. We have been telling people not to panic as HIV does not spread through water. But the people are not convinced and they have started draining out the lake,” said Dharwad district health officer Dr Rajendra Doddamani. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) spreads only through body fluids. Outside the human body, the virus cannot survive beyond minutes in air or water.Dr Glory Alexander, founder-director of Asha Foundation, which treats HIV+ patients, said it was a case of fear rather than stigma. “It’s sheer ignorance stemming from lack of awareness. When an HIV-positive person dies, the virus also dies. Even if the virus comes out of the body, it cannot survive in water and dies in a couple of seconds. There is no risk of infection spreading from the water,” she said.The body of the woman was found in the lake on November 29. Word immediately spread the water had been contaminated, creating panic. Villagers refused to drink the water and pressured the gram panchayat and the Navalgund taluk administration to drain the lake. Authorities tried to convince the villagers that the water was not contaminated and that they would test the water, but no one relented. The authorities have now deployed 20 siphon tubes with four motors to pump out the water.We found the body in a highly decomposed state,” said Muttanna Bhavaikatti, from Morab village. “We don’t want to consume contaminated water. We are trekking 2-3km to fetch water from the Malaprabha right bank canal that flows through Morab,” he said.Pradeep Hanikere, another villager, said the daily hardship was preferable to drinking water from the lake. “Do the officials drink bottled water if they find dirt or a speck in it? If they can’t, then how can they force us to drink water from the lake where we found the body of a woman,” he said.Another villager pointed out, “We would have consumed the water if it was the body of a normal person, but the woman died of HIV. There is no other way. The authorities must drain out water and fill it with fresh water to save the lives of villagers.”Gram panchayat member Laxman Patil said the villagers refused to see reason, so pipes have been sucking water out for the past four days. “We managed to drain out lakhs of litres, and discharged the water in a nearby stream. We still have to drain water from 60% of the lake and need at least five days to empty it,” he said. There is another problem, though. “The taluk administration wants us to complete the task by December 6. They have warned the Malaprabha right canal will be closed after December 8, so we have to fill the water into lake before that. More than 50 people are involved in pumping out water. We will need 1-2 weeks to empty and fill the lake.”Navalgund tahsildar Naveen Hullur said: “We tried to convince people to drink the lake water but they refused. We offered to conduct tests to prove the water is fit to drink. I will talk to officials to allow us to fill the lake from Malaprabha canal till December 20 or 22.”","['canal', 'woman', 'malaprabha', 'villagers', 'lake', 'drink', 'karnataka', 'drowns', 'body', 'water', 'drain', 'refused', 'virus', 'hiv']","HUBBALLI:The residents of Morab, around 30km from Hubballi, have refused to drink water from their village lake after an HIV-positive woman committed suicide by jumping into it a week ago.

Hinjawadi

There is no law that sympathises with HIV+ patients. We filed evidence which showed that she was terminated illegally and only because she was HIV+ — Vishal Jadhav, advocate representing the woman

Two years after she was dismissed from her job at a pharmaceutical firm after a medical report mentioned that she was HIV+, a 32-year-oldis looking at some semblance of. The labour court has directed the Hinjawadi-based company to pay her full wages for the years she lost out on work, restore her job and give her additional benefits.The woman hails from, completed junior college and got married in May 2002. Afterwards, she and her husband moved to Pune. In 2004, her husband was diagnosed withand died in September 2006. Meanwhile, the woman underwent a medical check-up and found that she, too, had contracted the disease. Neither her in-laws or her parents wanted anything to do with her once this was revealed.But, she was determined to carry on with her life. She underwent medical tests and counselling from the government and from various NGOs where she was advised that since the disease carries major stigma in society, there was no need for her to disclose her condition unless specifically asked. She was also assured that there was likelihood of a proper cure being discovered soon.Since she had no major discomfort or visible deformity, she joined a pharmaceutical company in Pune in 2007. Three years later, in 2010, she moved to another pharmaceutical company inas a junior operator in the production department. She completed all necessary formalities and underwent the medical check-up and physical fitness tests. The company had a medical insurance policy, of which she was a member.In the last week of April 2015, the woman had an ear ailment. It grew increasingly severe and she was admitted to a private hospital in Pune, and later, went to Kolhapur for treatment.She was on leave on medical grounds for almost three months and her leave was sanctioned by the company. She rejoined on July 20, 2015 and had submitted her medical reports for insurance benefits to the human resources (HR) department.That was where things started going downhill. While going through her reports, the HR personnel noticed that she was HIV+. On August 4, 2015, she was asked to resign.Claiming it was forceful termination, she filed a case against the company.Speaking to Mirror, the woman said, “The HR and administration department officials called me to their cabin. Other officials were present, too. They told me clearly that since I am HIV+, the company could not allow me to continue my services. They pressured and coerced me for nearly two hours, though I refused to resign and told them that I am physically and mentally fit. I also explained that I was taking all necessary precautions while working and I was even ready for an alternate job in the housekeeping department as I am in dire need of employment and community support.”“Throughout my five years of service, I did not get a single memo or notice — my professional record is spotless. The company had even given me an increment. All of this happened suddenly and my pleas went unheeded. I was alone in my battle against the company officials and I finally succumbed,” she added sombrely.And, her case could not be fought on grounds of sympathy, as advocate Vishal Jadhav, who represented her, pointed out.“There is no law that sympathises with HIV+ patients. We did not even fight to gain the sympathy of the court. We simply filed all the documentary evidence which showed that she was terminated illegally and only because she was HIV+. The company failed to prove that she had resigned from the job voluntarily or that they had paid her a month’s extra salary on her request, as they claimed. We proved that the resignation which she filed was not a resignation in the eyes of the law,” said Jadhav.“Her work was satisfactory and she was efficient. She is a widow and depends upon her employment simply so she can live with dignity,” Jadhav added.The company, however, denied all the allegations.Advocate NP Noronha, representing the firm, argued that she had resigned due to health reasons. Also, she had already availed of gratuity, bonus, leave and other post-termination benefits. He also submitted that the company officials and staff were already aware of her medical condition.“The HR department never took cognisance of the fact that she was HIV+. They were only worried for her excess absenteeism,” Noronha submitted.The company examined five witnesses in support of its claim, but the court did not find them adequate.Presiding officer of the labour court, Kalpana N Phatangare, stated, “An HIV+ woman, with no means of livelihood other than her job, cannot resign. There is no evidence showing that she was physically unfit and thus made up her mind to resign. On the contrary, the evidence on record shows that she was mentally and physically fit till the date of her alleged resignation. Further, the evidence shows that the company was satisfied with her services. There was no misconduct on her part.”“It can be said that this was not resignation, but termination on the part of the company. And a firm dealing with medicines and providing them to the world shouldn’t have a taken such a decision and victimised the woman,” Phatangare added.","['job', 'woman', 'resignation', 'sacked', 'orders', 'evidence', 'filed', 'company', 'hr', 'justice', 'firm', 'officials', 'medical', 'court', 'hiv']","Meanwhile, the woman underwent a medical check-up and found that she, too, had contracted the disease.
