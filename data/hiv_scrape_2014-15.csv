They have to wait a long time to get their results as well,"" said Leena Menghaney, campaign coordinator, MSF.According to recent guidelines of World Health Organization (WHO), HIV positive people who are on antiretroviral treatment(ART) need to get a VLT done annually to ensure correct treatment.Menghaney added that VLT accessibility in some African countries was better than in India. Citing an example of an HIV positive Manipuri girl who lost her life while waiting for a VLT, community members of PLHIV expressed that treatment monitoring was a necessity.""HIV positive people in the region, whose first line of treatment had failed, could die waiting for access to VLT to confirm treatment failure. We want DAC to respond to the situation here and ensure that patients do not face unnecessary delays in their clinical assessment,"" said Rakjumar Nalinkanta, president, CONE.Till July 2013, Mizoram had 8,258 HIV positive people, with 2,556 patients on ART, 12 patients on second line treatment, and 14 people waiting for VLT. Two people died last year in December while waiting for VLT. In Manipur, there are more than 40,000 HIV positive people. VLT determines the success of ART. There are VLT machines in Manipur, Assam and Megahalya but they are not recognized by NACO.Viral Load Test measures the number of copies of HIV'S genetic material (RNA) in every millilitre of blood. A person's viral load is undetectable when there are less than 50 copies per millilitre of blood, implying that the virus has been suppressed.The test prevents patients from being given more expensive drugs by doctors. However, owing to its high price of VRL, a patient's CD4 white blood cells are still used to monitor a patient's response to treatment.","['waiting', 'hiv', 'blood', 'patients', 'test', 'essential', 'risk', 'positive', 'vlt', 'puts', 'treatment', 'centres', 'manipur', 'load', 'dearth', 'northeast']","GUWAHATI: With only sevenViral Load Test (VLT) centres in the country, and none of them in the northeast, HIV positive people in states like Mizonram, Nagaland, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh expressed concern over the difficulty of accessing VLTs.

Manipur's Surachanpur and Bishnupur districts have the highest number of people carrying the Hepatitis-C virus (HCV), with prevalence rates among the districts' IDUs being nearly 90 per cent and 78 per cent respectively.In Nagaland's Wokha and Phek districts, the prevalence rate, as per an Integrated Bio Behavioural Assessment Round 2 Testing, conducted in 2009 by the Indian Council of Medical Research and others, was 20.8 per cent and 8.7 per cent respectively. Prior studies showed that in Manipur, the prevalence rate of HCV is 55 to 80 per cent among IDUs, as opposed to 22 to 33 per cent HIV prevalence among them.""The main objective is to create awareness about viral Hepatitis in the region. The epidemic is at our doorstep, with people getting infected, testing positive and some deaths being reported. However, NGOs and the government continue to ignore the spread of the disease,"" said Ketho, general secretary of Hepatitis Coalition of Nagaland (HEPCON).With much of the focus being restricted to HIV-AIDS and cancer awareness, HCV often escapes attention. With no proper cure or vaccine, course-related HCV treatment is also considered too expensive. People with HCV are prone to develop chronicity that can lead to liver damages. Research show that close to 75 to 85 per cent HCV patients develop chronicity, as opposed to Hepatitis-B patients (HBV).""Intravenous drug users are the most vulnerable. HCV prevalence is much higher than that of HIV. This indicates that there is a bigger pool of HCV patients among IDUs,"" said Gajendra Kumar Medhi, doctor and scientist with the Indian Council of Medical Research.Another factor responsible for the high prevalence of HCV amongst IDUs is needle-sharing. Even with efforts to promote safe injecting practices, the prevalence of needle-sharing is quite high. Users may lessen sharing of syringes, but indirect sharing is widely practiced. Nearly 50 to 70 per cent IDUs admitted to sharing accessories like common containers for drug preparation, filter cotton and rinse water.","['hcv', 'sharing', 'idus', 'cent', 'hiv', 'virus', 'prevalence', 'patients', 'drug', 'bigger', 'medical', 'districts', 'hepatitisc', 'northeast', 'epidemic', 'users']","Prior studies showed that in Manipur, the prevalence rate of HCV is 55 to 80 per cent among IDUs, as opposed to 22 to 33 per cent HIV prevalence among them.

An erratic drug supply of second-line medication has forced thousands of patients—some from as far as Nagpur, Sindhudurg, Akola and even parts of Gujarat—to frequent the treatment centre multiple times a week to collect the drugs instead of the usual once-a-month practice.“Most HIV-positive people hide their status at their workplace. We cannot afford to seek leave every alternate day to collect the medicines. Several people have lost their jobs because of this,” said an HIV patient, adding that lately he has been asking for leave once every week. The Bhayander resident said he has already switched jobs twice as too many questions about his absenteeism were raised at the workplace.Another HIV-positive patient, a 37-year-old Sion resident, said he has been missing doses as his boss has started questioning his medical fitness. “How many leaves can an office grant in a week? We cannot even buy the drugs from outside given the steep cost,” he complained.Patients are livid that while other four ART centres—in Nagpur, Aurangabad, Pune and Sangli—have dealt with the medicine shortage by procuring them locally, the same zeal was lacking at JJ, which has been accused of inadequate supply of drugs for the last six months. The only centre to disburse second-line medicines in city, it also caters to patients from Konkan region.An official from the state Aids control society said the hospital has recently purchased second-line medicines worth Rs16 lakh, but the patients rejected the claim.

Laboratory testing confirmed that the woman with newly diagnosed HIV infection had avirus virtually identical to that of her female partner, who was diagnosed previously with HIV and who had stopped receiving antiretroviral treatment in 2010.The woman with newly acquired infection did not report any other recognized risk factors for HIV infection, and the viruses infecting the two women had 98% sequence identity in three genes.Transmission of HIV between women who have sex with women (WSW) has been reported rarely and is difficult to ascertain.The potential for HIV transmission by female-to-female sexual contact includes unprotected exposure to vaginal or other body fluids and to blood from menstruation , or to exposure to blood from trauma during rough sex.Other potential exposures associated with HIV transmission in WSW that must be ruled out include injection drug use (IDU), heterosexual sex, tattooing, acupuncture , piercing, use of shared sex toys between the partners and other persons, exposure to body fluids of others, and receipt of transplants or transfusion, the report said. The woman who acquired HIV had a history of heterosexual intercourse, but not in the 10 years before HIV infection.She reported three female sexual partners in the preceding 5 years but said she had no IDU, receipt of tattoos, acupuncture, transfusions, transplants, or any other recognised HIV risk behaviour . The woman supplemented her income by selling her plasma and had tested negative for HIV by HIV-1 /2 enzyme immunoassay (EIA) serology screening after donating plasma in March 2012.In April, 10 days after donating plasma, the woman went to an emergency department with a sore throat, fever, vomiting, decreased appetite, pain on swallowing , dry cough, frequent diarrhoea, and muscle cramps.At that time, she was again tested for HIV by EIA serology screening , and the results were negative.

She approached a mid-level hospital in Sundarapuram and got her admission form done. However, when she told the staff that she was HIV positive, they returned her admission and claimed they had too many patients lined up for colonoscopy for the next two days and didn't have a vacant bed even in the general ward. ""They asked me to a call three days later or better approach a government hospital for the test,"" she said.The Coimbatore Positive Network, a city-based NGO, said the polite rejection that Kamakshi received was better than usual. ""Almost all private hospitals in the city and surrounding districts refuse to treat or operate on HIV patients,"" said the network's president M Somesh. ""They tell patients that they don't have facilities or infrastructure to treat HIV positive people,"" he said. They tell them to go to government hospitals in Coimbatore or Pollachi, he added.A campaign by the network sensitization programmes held by Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS), three large hospitals have agreed to treat and operate HIV patients. ""We have got them to conduct around 15 deliveries so far,"" says Somesh. However, these hospitals charge HIV patients twice the amount they take from regular patients. ""They claim they have to purchase disposable instruments and gear such as gloves, masks, costumes which they have to dispose after one use and hence the higher charge,"" said Somesh. But we are glad that they at least treat us, so we have learned to bear the costs, he said.Though Coimbatore district has more than 10,300 registered HIV positive patients, the two government hospitals and one link centre are the only venues where a patient can get Anti retroviral therapy (ART) at subsidised rate. ""Even if other private hospitals offer ART, they do not tell us. In fact, hospitals that treat HIV positive patients do not want it to be known,"" said Somesh.Hospitals said they can't be blamed, because ART medication is expensive and the general public is scared of being treated along-side HIV positive patients. ""We have a separate wing to treat HIV patients, conduct surgeries and even do deliveries. We do not publicise it much because we do not want our general patients to live in fear of a transfusion mistake or infection,"" said a doctor at one of the hospitals that treat HIV patients. ""We do not want doctors to lose out on their normal patients,"" he added.Surprisingly, not a single complaint has been filed against any hospital for rejecting a HIV positive patient.

Not just ill-informed and superstitious Khap Panchayats but even our educated and intelligent health service providers have apparently added a fifth 'varna' to our patriarchal, parochial, and stratified society. At the very bottom of the heap are the new untouchables - those who are denied c-sections, gallbladder and other surgical interventions, those who can't get broken bones mended - children, women, and men testing positive for HIV The first-ever survey conducted by HIV positive people (also called PLHA) on HIV positive people in Patna came to light recently. So much is the fear of being ostracized that 50% of those surveyed haven't disclosed their status to their family while 77% haven't disclosed their status to close friends. While 5% lost their share of property, 2% of the women were thrown out of their homes. As many as 34% of those employed face problems at the workplace after their HIV status became known. However, the majority of the survey sample consisted of those in the informal sector.The Community Health Medicinal Unit (CHMU) presented their findings on issues and problems of people with HIV and AIDS in a consultation attended by prominent members of the HIV/AIDS fraternity, including representatives from state government bodies, NGOs, doctors, lawyers and so on. The report reflected the growing anxiety of PLHA and their families about the denial of surgical procedures and treatment by government doctors, some incidents of which have been highlighted in the local media.By and large, BSACS ( Bihar State AIDS Control Society ) and the state government have ensured regular and timely dispensing of ART (antiretroviral therapy) medicines that PLHA need with 94% of the survey respondents giving positive responses about the facilities available in Patna (PMCH and RMRI). But no PLHA gets treatment for opportunistic infections from the PHCs (primary health centres). Greater coordination is needed between BSACS, government and civil society to address issues that go beyond the mere distribution of free medicines.""Doctors belong to the educated and enlightened section of our society, but there are among them (those) who practice untouchability vis-à-vis persons with HIV,"" said the report. The doctors attending the event claimed there were orthopaedic surgeons and gynaecologists in the city who have never refused to operate on patients with HIV, but these can be counted on the finger of one hand, says Chandy Joseph of CHMU.The conference recognized that surgeons fear contracting HIV by coming into contact with infected body fluids during operative procedures, and government hospitals are not provided good quality protective gear. It strongly recommended that the government supply adequate protective kits to surgical departments to deal with this issue.Doctors Diwakar Tejaswi and A K Singh said the government should turn its attention to upgrading four key factors that impact PLHA and are linked to prejudice against them. These factors include doctors and training programmes, availability of post-prick prophylaxis, availability of protection kits and care and nursing services training for serving PLHA.The doctors recommended that the government should conduct trainings and orientations for medical service providers and paramedics on how to provide services to PLHA, and enlist as resource persons surgeons such as Dr John Mukhopadhyay, Dr Manoj Kumar and others who regularly perform surgical interventions for PLHA so that there could be a sharing of ideas that will lead to a reduction in stigma and discrimination.The conference also recommended that PLHA should be entitled to BPL status and accorded the entitlements by virtue of their condition in the spirit of the Supreme Court judgments. This status could be provided on the basis of the ART card. Special efforts should be made to ensure that the Right to Education Act norms of elementary education effectively covers children with HIV.The positive attitude of the representatives of the PLHA attending the conference was remarkable. ""Yes, many of us face discrimination, even abuse, but we are not here to point fingers. Let's educate each other, understand our fears, and engage with civil society and government more actively,"" said Sanjeet Singh, the person who has successfully used the PIL route to bring relief to affected members of the PLHA community.","['society', 'hiv', 'doctors', 'positive', 'survey', 'untouchables', 'plha', 'surgeons', 'state', 'surgical', 'status']","At the very bottom of the heap are the new untouchables - those who are denied c-sections, gallbladder and other surgical interventions, those who can't get broken bones mended - children, women, and men testing positive for HIV The first-ever survey conducted by HIV positive people (also called PLHA) on HIV positive people in Patna came to light recently.

Instead, they tied the knot, and thanks to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) their child is HIV negative.For Melvin and Janet D'Souza, both also HIV positive , the tying of the knot happened 30 years ago. They chose not to have children.NGOs working towards enlightening society on the humane treatment of those with HIV say more and more people with AIDS in Goa are taking the plunge into marriage.""Loneliness and lack of companionship often lead to neglect of one's health, so having a partner does create an environment for a better future and longer life,"" says Maria Cardoso, project officer at Udant.Anita Pereira, also with the NGO, says, ""Many who have HIV initially have doubts about getting married, but, HIV does not prevent anyone from marrying, it only requires a little more responsibility and trust from both people in the relationship.""Medications, new infections, family issues and failing health burden HIV-positive couples everyday.

These reports included a TOI report on the death of a woman at the hospital due to alleged lack of sensitivity on the part of hospital authorities.The PIL has been filed by a person with HIV.

Of late, both doctors and nurses in Trichy hospitals are alert to HIV risks from patients undergoing surgery. There have been cases where HIV-positive women who were admitted for delivery or caesarean didn't disclose their health condition fearing discrimination. To be on the safer side, doctors are now insisting on HIV tests for all surgery cases.Sources said two HIV-positive pregnant women got admitted at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH) for emergency delivery in October and December last year. Only after completing the surgery, doctors came to know that they were HIV-infected. ""A nurse fainted after knowing that the blood scattered on her during the delivery was of an HIV-infected woman.

But based on our studies of blood samples collected from 17 patients, we found that for 150mg of rifabutin to work, patients would have to take the drug every day,” said Dr Geetha Ramachandran, who led the study.The subjects of the study were all patients at Government Hospital of Thoracic Medicine, Tambaram. All of them had failed to respond to first-line treatment.Researchers found that the RNTCP stipulated dosage administered to seven patients was too low to counter the disease. Four of the subjects died during the course of the study.“Ten of the patients, who received a dosage of around 30mg/ml higher than that prescribed by the RNTCP, showed favourable response to the treatment,” Dr Ramachandran said.Experts say the dosage of the drug has always been a matter of debate, with doctors exercising extra caution due to possible chemical interaction of medicines for HIV and TB.“While in some countries like the US, the dosage of rifabutin has been increased from 150mg three days a week to the same amount daily, in India insufficient data and studies resulted in health authorities failing to increase the dosage,” NIRT director Soumya Swaminathan said.The researchers have presented the results of the study to the National AIDS Control Organisation. “A multi-centric study will be undertaken in different parts of the country to assess the effect of rifabutin. This could change the drug regimen for HIV-positive patients with TB,” Dr Swaminathan said.Experts say 60%-70% of HIV-infected patients are likely to develop TB, mostly those on second-line therapy.“There are several factors that may lead to poor treatment outcome, including malnutrition and other infections. The dosage of rifabutin, which kills the bacteria, is also a contributing factor which can’t be taken lightly. Although we recommend daily dosage, more studies will be required to determine the optimal level,” Dr Ramachandran said.","['reveals', 'hiv', 'counter', 'drug', 'patients', 'rntcp', 'dr', 'key', 'study', 'low', 'studies', 'dosage', 'tuberculosis', 'tb', 'rifabutin']","All of them had failed to respond to first-line treatment.Researchers found that the RNTCP stipulated dosage administered to seven patients was too low to counter the disease.

The decision has been taken to promote birth of HIV-free children.The Rajasthan State Aids Control Society (RSACS) has initiated lifelong multi-drug antiretroviral (ARV) regimens for all pregnant and breast-feeding women living with HIV. The transmission of HIV from infected mother to her newborn is one of the leading causes of spread of HIV. According to RSACS, it is estimated that 5.2% of total HIV infections are due to transmission of HIV from mother to newborn.To deal with it, earlier the RSACS was providing single dose of Nevirapine to such women at the time of labour pain to prevent the HIV transmission from mother to her newborn baby. But, from May 19, the RSACS has changed its strategy.Health department's project director (AIDS) Dr SS Chauhan said, ""From an HIV infected mother, the risk of vertical transmission of HIV to newborn is 30%. But, a single dose of Nevirapine reduces the risk to around 15%. So far we were giving single dose of Nevirapine to pregnant women at the time of delivery. But, still the high risk (up to 15%) remained the cause of concern for us. Now, to bring down the percentage of risk of vertical transmission of HIV from mother to her newborn, we have initiated the lifelong ART (triple drug regimen). The multidrug ARV regimen would further decrease the risk from 11% to up to 5%.

They take consent of pregnant women for HIV testing. If the women test positive for HIV, they link the women with anti retroviral therapy centre. Also, they put effort to prevent the transmission of HIV to her newborn.In 2013-14, the RSACS conducted HIV testing on 4.68 lakh pregnant women and found 412 women living with HIV.

Hence, we are not inclined to confirm the death sentence.""On March 26, 2013, the district and sessions court at Islampur had convicted and sentenced him to death for raping and murdering the girl. The victim, a resident of Sangli, was studying in standard two in a local school.The prosecution's case is that on February 26, 2011, the man had taken the girl from school to Kalammawadi, near Kasegaon in Walva tehsil and raped her in a sugarcane field. He then strangled her and fled to Pune. When the girl did not come back from school, her mother told her husband.He inquired with the school teacher who had told him that she had gone with her maternal uncle. After a search, the girl's father registered a criminal case with the Kasegaon police station.The rapist was arrested after investigations revealed his involvement in the crime. The victim's body was recovered from the sugarcane field.The trial court had sentenced him to death under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). He was sentenced to life imprisonment for rape under section 376 (2) (f) of the IPC. He was also sentenced to three years' rigorous imprisonment each for kidnapping and destroying evidence under sections 363 and 201 of the IPC.The trial court had sent a reference to the high court for confirming the death sentence. He had also filed a criminal appeal challenging the death sentence in the high court.Additional public prosecutor Mankuwar Deshmukh relied on aggravating circumstances to prove that the accused had brutally raped and murdered a defenceless girl. She pleaded to confirm death sentence as the girl was last seen in the company of the accused.She relied on the DNA report to prove that the blood stains found on the victim's frock matched his blood group. She submitted that the rapist was a habitual offender as he had two cases registered against him with the Chinchwad police station here in 2009 and 2011. The HC later found that he had been acquitted in both the cases.The HC appointed lawyer Abhaykumar Apte to represent the man from its legal aid committee. Apte argued that police had not recorded his statement to show that the dead body was recovered at his instance.He also challenged the identification parade of the accused on the grounds that the witnesses had seen him at the police station.The HC's observations Quoting several Supreme Court judgments, the HC bench said, ""The man was suffering from HIV and this was the only mitigating circumstance in his favour for commuting his death sentence to life imprisonment.""The HC also sought his doctor's advice on whether his life span will be that of an ordinary man if he continued with the medicines. While partly allowing his appeal, the HC on examining the evidence maintained his conviction under sections of the IPC, but commuted the death sentence given for murder to life imprisonment.The HC also commuted the life imprisonment awarded for rape to 10 years RI. However, both the sentences will run consecutively. The sentences of three years RI each awarded for kidnapping and destruction of evidence will run concurrently.

Repeat viral load blood testing performed 72 hours later confirmed this finding (10,564 copies/mL of virus).Additionally, the child had decreased levels of CD4+ T-cells, a key component of a normal immune system, and the presence of HIV antibodies — signals of an actively replicating pool of virus in the body.The child was again started on ART. Genetic sequencing of the virus indicated that the child’s HIV infection was the same strain acquired from the mother.Delegates pray for individuals that have perished due to HIV-AIDS at the 31st International AIDS Candlelight Memorial in Manila (Getty Images)The child continues to receive medical care, treatment and monitoring from Hannah Gay, a pediatric HIV specialist at the University of Mississippi Medical Center who has been involved in the child’s care since birth.Researchers say they will now work to better understand what enabled the child to remain off treatment for more than two years without detectable virus or measurable immunologic response and what might be done to extend the period of sustained HIV remission in the absence of ART.“The fact that this child was able to remain off antiretroviral treatment for two years and maintain quiescent virus for that length of time is unprecedented,” said Deborah Persaud, professor of infectious diseases at the John Hopkins Children’s Center in Baltimore and one of the two pediatric HIV experts involved in the ongoing analysis of the case. “Typically, when treatment is stopped, HIV levels rebound within weeks, not years”.Quilts embroidered with the names of AIDS victims (Getty Images)“The case of the Mississippi child indicates that early antiretroviral treatment in this HIV-infected infant did not completely eliminate the reservoir of HIV-infected cells that was established upon infection but may have considerably limited its development and averted the need for antiretroviral medication over a considerable period,” said Dr Fauci.“Now we must direct our attention to understanding why that is and determining whether the period of sustained remission in the absence of therapy can be prolonged even further.”HIV first sprung its head over 30 years ago and has till now infected over 34 million people worldwide.Finding a vaccine against HIV has been a daunting challenge.The UN estimates that 330,000 babies were infected in 2011. This is apart from more than three million children living with HIV around the world.In India, more than 14,000 children got infected in 2011, which accounted for 13% decline compared to 2009. The number of estimated deaths among children (0-14 years old) due to AIDS was 10,213 in 2011.In India, children accounted for 7% of an estimated 21 lakh people living with HIV/AIDS in 2011. Around 40% (8.16 lakh) of them were women, who are likely to pass on the virus to their children.The baby in question was born prematurely in a Mississippi clinic in 2010 to an HIV-infected mother who did not receive ART medication during pregnancy and was not diagnosed with HIV infection until the time of delivery. Because of the high risk of HIV exposure, the infant was started at 30 hours of age on liquid, triple-drug antiretroviral treatment. Testing confirmed within several days that the baby had been infected with HIV. At two weeks of age, the baby was discharged from the hospital and continued on liquid antiretroviral therapy.The baby continued on antiretroviral treatment until 18 months of age, when the child was lost to follow up and no longer received treatment. Yet, when the child was again seen by medical staff five months later, blood samples revealed undetectable HIV levels (less than 20 copies of HIV per milliliter of blood (copies/mL)) and no HIV-specific antibodies. The child continued to do well in the absence of antiretroviral medicines and was free of detectable HIV for more than two years.“The prolonged lack of viral rebound, in the absence of HIV-specific immune responses, suggests that the very early therapy not only kept this child clinically well, but also restricted the number of cells harboring HIV infection,” said Katherine Luzuriaga, professor of molecular medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.A Global Plan on HIV has two main targets for 2015: a 90% reduction in the number of children newly infected with HIV and a 50% reduction in the number of AIDS-related maternal deaths. The Plan focuses on the 22 countries which account for 90% of new HIV infections among children which includes India.","['miracle', 'girl', 'infected', 'blow', 'hiv', 'suffering', 'virus', 'antiretroviral', 'massive', 'cured', 'treatment', 'child', 'medical', 'infection', 'children', 'levels', 'baby']","“Scientifically, this development reminds us that we still have much more to learn about the intricacies of HIV infection and where the virus hides in the body”.A routine clinical care visit earlier this month has revealed that the child has detectable HIV levels in the blood (16,750 copies/mL).

55,17-7-2014,[],https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg,"With the issue of HIV related stigma and discrimination being addressed in the state, I have attempted to put more light on the issue. There is need to understand the issue, not only in relation to the children who are facing discrimination, but close to 14,000 odd HIVpositive individuals found positive in Goa. Rivona case should help us to strategize for a long term impact.Goa had set an example to the rest of country three decades ago and had created an impact in addressing HIV-related stigma and discrimination. India's first HIV litigation arose when HIVpositive activist Dominic D'Souza was incarcerated in the late 1980s. D'Souza, a resident of Goa, was found to be HIVpositive when he donated blood at a Goa hospital. The test was performed without his knowledge or consent, and the results were revealed not to him, but to the local police.D'Souza was subsequently arrested and confined in an unused TB sanatorium pursuant to the Goa, Daman and Diu Public Health Act, 1985, an amendment to which in 1986 authorized the state to mandatorily test any person for HIV and isolate them if they tested HIVpositive.He challenged the Goa Public Health Amendment Act, which called for mandatory isolation of an HIVpositive person. He won a partial victory when the court ruled detainment was mandatory only in a ""justifiable"" case. His legacy continues through Positive, the NGO he started to help people living with HIV.Dominic's case highlighted several aspects of the laws that are related to the HIV epidemic beyond the application (or mis-application) of public health laws. Dominic was tested for HIV without his consent, his confidentiality was breached, and eventually, when he was released, he had lost his job.Since that first case, violations of the rights of people living with or affected by HIV have increasingly come to light, many legal cases have been fought and won or lost, and many judgments have been pronounced by the courts.It should be understood that those who stigmatize people living with HIV falsely believe that the virus is highly contagious and that they could easily become infected. When that happens, others start to view HIV-positive as a threat. Many become isolated - within their homes, in public, at their workplaces. They are further stigmatized by others' assumptions about their moral integrity - such as the belief that they became infected with HIV because they chose to take part in risky behaviors.Also, stigma and discrimination continue to undermine prevention, treatment and care of people living with the HIV and AIDS. It hinders those with the virus from telling their partners about their status. It threatens their access to health care. It increases their vulnerability to physical violence. And HIV-related stigma affects people's ability to earn a living, making it even more difficult for them to lift themselves out of poverty.HIV and AIDS have highlighted such vast inequities, violent abuse and widespread stigma, that human rights have been violated in a manner and on a scale rarely witnessed before in the public health sphere. The HIV epidemic cannot be looked upon as just a medical problem. It touches on the most personal behaviours and aspects of people's lives, and its effect is felt in every sphere of a person's life. Combating it therefore demands an approach that integrates social, cultural, economic and human rights perspectives.While we discuss this, I wish to bring to fore more issues related to this. Once an adolescent finds out about his or her HIV status, disclosure, safer sex and family planning become pressing issues, requiring services tailored to the specific needs of adolescents. Despite the growing importance of this population group, they are largely left out of HIV/AIDS responses in the state. One effect is that existing paediatric and adult services are often ill-equipped to deal with their complex needs.This emerging situation underscores the need to recognize these adolescents in Goa as well, learn more about their lives, identify their preventive information needs and service priorities, and design appropriate programs for their special needs. Civil society organizations and the state at large, need to have planned and sustainable programmes for children, rather address issues as they come to the fore.While, I highlight the above, I also wish to bring to the attention of public at large, some of the instances of stigma and discrimination faced by people living with HIV in Goa. Discrimination in medical setting is widely prevalent. Surprisingly, even I came across staff of an NGO working in the premises of GMC to provide services, identifying HIV patients and alerting others to maintain distance. Some who are availing 50% bus concession from KTC also face discrimination by conductors who sometimes grill them on the card and also deny them concession. Most of the migrant PLHIVs, including children are denied social entitlement and social security schemes. People accessing DSS schemes are constantly under fear and sometimes refrain from accessing schemes due to fear of status being revealed.The government besides providing some social entitlements should also focus on long term HIV impact mitigation. It's high time that all stakeholders working to address HIV in the state come together on a common platform and address HIV through need-based, planned and sustained programmes. It requires commitment, courage and leadership at all levels.(The writer is the founder of Human Touch and secretary of Positive People.

On World Hepatitis Day on Monday, World Health Organization called for using similar strategies and infrastructure to check the spread of infection caused by Hepatitis viruses.The issue was discussed at the first roundtable consultation on viral hepatitis organized by WHO at Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences ""The HIV/AIDS programme in India has been successful mainly because of its robust sentinel surveillance mechanism, involvement of community health workers and NGOs to spread awareness and availability of free drugs. These strategies and infrastructure can be used to spread awareness about Hepatitis B and C that follow similar modes of transmission,"" said Dr Nicole Seguy, technical advisor at the WHO country office.There are five main hepatitis viruses, of which B and C cause the most fatalities as these can lead to liver cirrhosis and cancer. Dr Seguy said preventive measures such as compulsory vaccination for Hepatitis B, promoting safe sex and screening of blood for infections at the time of transfusion can help check the spread of diseases.""Though there is treatment available for Hepatitis C , few can afford it. The government should make efforts to subsidize or make drugs available for free to those infected,"" she added.Dr S K Sarin, director of ILBS, said a key recommendation made by the experts group at the WHO meet was that the government should utilize services of 17,000 HIV surveillance centres for screening Hepatitis B and C patients. ""If one person in the family has Hepatitis B, chances of others having it are high. It is important to screen them for the virus before vaccination because the vaccines can only protect uninfected patients,"" he said.Nata Menabde, WHO representative to India, also stressed on the need for reliable information on viral hepatitis for building prevention and control measures. ""WHO calls upon all partners and stakeholders to make the 'silent' epidemic of viral hepatitis more visible and more manageable,"" she said.""We have had massive awareness campaigns for polio, HIV or tuberculosis in our country. Hepatitis is also one such disease which can be prevented to a large extent if people know about it,"" said Dr S K Acharya, HOD, gastroenterology, at AIIMS.

These girls now believe that they are not just patients but also human beings,” says Savani. He has even named his farmhouse ‘Janani Dham’.

But with limited budget they had no other option than to ask government for accommodation facility.After Savani offered his farmhouse, these girls have a sprawling garden and a play area equipped with a couple of rides for their recreation.“Living in a lush green area has helped create positivity among them and it has improved their health. No major infections as well as improvements in CD4 count reflect their healthy condition. They can now access good education and meet other citizens regularly,” says Daksha Patel, vice-president of GSNP+.Savani is now planning to accommodate HIV+ widows at the same farmhouse.“If things move ahead as planned, we will soon support HIV+ women by offering them home at ‘Janani Dham’.

The boy rushes to the doctor's chamber, takes his coat and runs back. The doctor and nurse rush behind him. Back with mom, the child says he resorted to the ?theft' just to bring his mother's case to the doctor's notice.Has the message percolated down to the doctors? Apparently not. A 45-year old HIV+ woman died at the PMCH after being denied surgery to remove intestinal obstruction in September last year. Amid much hue and cry, the state health department promised a slew of reforms to ensure people with HIV were not denied healthcare for their other ailments, but they seem to have remained on paper. Even the Patna high court's prods in this regard have gone in vain.Had it not been so, 45-yr-old Ram Kumar would not have been made to run from pillar to post ? from IGIMS to NMCH to PMCH, to be precise ? to get his urethra dilated. More than ten visits to these government healthcare facilities notwithstanding, Kumar remains untreated.It was on August 4, 2009 that Kumar visited the IGIMS' urology department for the first time. Investigations were conducted on him. ""However, when it was discovered that I am HIV positive, I was told to go away. As my condition deteriorated, I visited the hospital again after four days. They again said it was not possible to operate me at the IGIMS,"" he said.As the complications increased, Kumar visited a private doctor. He prescribed treatment for a year but the surgery became a must. Kumar went to the NMCH in December 2013. He was refused surgery there too and was instead ""referred to PMCH/IGIMS.""To try his luck for the third time, the patient went to the IGIMS again and found history repeating itself. ""The machine through which the operation is done is not functional,"" Kumar quoted the same doctor as telling him this time.In July this year, Kumar went to the PMCH which referred him to the IGIMS. ""I have lost all hopes. The private doctor says it is high time I got operated upon. If I die, who will be responsible for my death?"" Kumar asked TOI on Friday.The doctors Kumar visited have written ""HIV+"" in bold letters on the top on his prescriptions despite the fact that the treatment protocol prohibits such ?announcements'. All that the doctors can write on such prescriptions is ?PLWHA' which stands for people living with HIV/AIDS.Kumar's is not a one-off case. Raja Singh of Chhoti Pahaari at Patna has been endlessly waiting for a heart surgery. He even visited a private hospital where the doctors told him he should go to the PMCH since his was an HIV case. He has made several rounds of the PMCH's Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology since then. Intermittently, he was referred to AIIMS, Safdarjung Hospital and G B Pant Hospital (all in Delhi).Gyan Ranjan, a social activist who has been taking cudgels on behalf of the people with HIV, says he gets 30 to 40 calls from such patients every week. They are denied surgeries ranging from uterus removal to orthopaedic restoration. A patient was denied endoscopy at PMCH last year, he said.According to Ranjan, doctors at times frighten away the patients by cooking up stories. ""Two months back, a 40-yr-old woman of Chhapra went to the PMCH to get her stone problem treated. Doctors told her she would die on the operation table and she returned without treatment. Such cases are common in orthopaedic department too,"" Ranjan said.""After the death of a woman last year, the PMCH administration promised it would allot an operation theatre for two days a week for surgery of people living with HIV.

However, in what is both a pointer to the vulnerability of the third gender and an indictment of a failure in social inclusiveness, the mortality rate of HIV-positive transgenders in the state increased by more than 1,600% over the same period. Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TNSACS) statistics, sourced by TOI through an RTI petition, show that 1,537 men and 814 women died of HIV/AIDS-related causes in 2009. Effective intervention by the state led to a decline in the numbers to 1,323 male and 595 female HIV/AIDS deaths in 2013, a fall of 18.42%.Tamil Nadu — one of the four worst HIV/AIDS affected states along with Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra — recorded only seven transgender deaths in 2009. The number climbed exponentially to 113 in 2013.If this does not appear to be strikingly high number, consider that the latest census statistics put the number of transgenders in the country at 4.9 lakh out of a total population in excess of 120 crore. That is 0.04% of the general population. By comparison, the HIV/AIDS mortality rate for transgenders by population in Tamil Nadu is 5.56%.Also, activists say, the actual numbers could be far higher because transgender deaths are hugely underreported.""Social stigma prevents the reporting of transgender deaths,"" says A J Hariharan, founder of NGO Indian Community Welfare Organisation , which works for the welfare of the sex workers and transgenders. According to the TNSACS data, the number of HIV-positive cases in the state dropped from 25,572 in 2009 to 17,055 in 2013, with the number of HIV-infected males decreasing from 14,835 to 9,868 and women from 10,665 to 7,127 over the same period.The figures raise several disconcerting questions. Have Tamil Nadu's highly acclaimed efforts to stem the spread of the disease not been an unqualified success? Is social inclusiveness a myth when it comes to transgenders despite several government initiatives to bring the community into the mainstream?Tamil Nadu was the first state to create a special welfare board for transgenders and provide them land, pension and separate ration cards. The Election Commission in 2009 created a separate entry for transgenders on voter lists. But transgenders say the welfare board has ceased to function.""It was after Tamil Nadu that other states like Maharashtra set up welfare board for transgenders. But unfortunately the board for all purposes does not exist,"" says R Jeeva, founder of NGO Transgender Rights Association and a former member of the welfare board.Other officials say lack of awareness is probably the main cause for the rise in deaths of transgenders. ""The increase in deaths of HIV-positive transgenders is a concern. It is most likely linked to unsafe sex,"" said Dr Vijaya Raman, deputy director of Tamil Nadu AIDS Initiative (TAI).But transgenders say they have little choice in the matter. Latha S, a 30-year-old transgender says she's a prostitute by compulsion and not by choice. While that may be true of most women and men who sell sex for money, individuals of the third gender — stigmatised, ridiculed and shunned — have far fewer chances of opting out of the profession than others.Latha says she did not have an education and no one would give her a job. ""I have been in the profession ever since I discovered I was a transgender and joined the community,"" she says. ""Once I left home there was no one to educate me or help me get employed.""Her job, Latha says, involves violence from drunks and rowdies. ""Customers often do not pay and policemen harass us and force us to pay a large chunk of what we earn for protection,"" she says.""I hate being a prostitute but I don't know what else to do,"" she says. What is worst, she says, is the vulnerability that she and other transgenders face and the constant fear it engenders.Transgenders usually leave home when they are around 16 years old, says A J Hariharan, the founder secretary of Indian Community Welfare Organisation (ICWO), an NGO that works for the welfare of the homeless, sex workers and transgenders. ""They join other transgenders and are pushed into begging and prostitution,"" he says. ""Lack of basic education means they are unable to get jobs and the stigma attached to them means even manual labour is not an option.""Hariharan says companies could, as part of their corporate social responsibility programmes, look to help transgenders. ""That would be empowering for members of the community because it would involve acceptance of the fact that transgenders are part of society and bring them into the mainstream, apart from giving them a livelihood,"" he says.But the discrimination that transgenders face leaves them with little optimism that they could win acceptance and integrate with society. ""Social acceptance? I don't know if that is possible,"" says transgender Raji Sekar, 25. ""We can't even take a house on rent because few landlords would want transgenders as tenants.""""I did not wish to be transgender,"" she says. ""I was born this way and that is what people should realise for society to accept us,"" she says.Her companion Ambika M, has bruises on her face and hands. She says a group of men beat her up a few days ago. ""We face intolerance all the time, so nobody cares about our safety,"" she says. ""Not a day goes by without a transgender being beaten up by customers or drunkards.""","['state', 'deaths', 'drop', 'hiv', 'transgender', 'trangender', 'tn', 'transgenders', 'nadu', 'rise', 'community', 'despite', 'fatalities', 'number', 'welfare', 'tamil', '2009']","CHENNAI: Has Tamil Nadu been successful in its battle against HIV/AIDS ?

The commission’s chairperson Samira Kazi said the department is exploring other possibilities of taking action against Prabhudessai.When contacted by STOI, Prabhudessai refused to reveal what he had advised the villagers, saying only, “I’m responsible for the welfare of my village.” Asked if he had misinformed locals about HIV/AIDS, he said he would reply only to an inquiry against him.Chief minister Manohar Parrikar recently assured the legislative assembly that action would be taken against the doctor, after Sanguem MLA Subhash Faldessai raised the issue in the House.Before his retirement, Prabhudessai worked for the directorate of health services and also served in the armed forces. Post retirement he runs a private practice at Colomb, Rivona. Asked if he is open to the idea of children with HIV being given admissions in regular schools, Prabhudessai said, “It is a debatable issue.” He refused to elaborate, saying he did not want to answer such questions telephonically.He informed STOI that he was registered with the Maharashtra Medical Council after getting his degree, as the Goa council did not exist then, and later he did register with the Goa council. It is mandatory for every doctor to register with the state medical council or MCI if they want to practice in India. It is also compulsory for doctors to renew this registration every five years.The controversy over admissions to HIV-positive children raged for over a fortnight in June-July, and was finally resolved through government intervention. It saw over 40 parents withdraw their wards from the school where the children with HIV were finally admitted.","['gets', 'misinformed', 'breather', 'council', 'hiv', 'rivona', 'village', 'medical', 'action', 'panel', 'prabhudessai', 'state', 'locals', 'goa', 'children', 'medico', 'admissions', 'doctor']","Post retirement he runs a private practice at Colomb, Rivona.

The ministry data shows that in neighbouring states like Maharashtra and Karnataka, where a larger number of women were screened, the percentage of women testing positive was significantly lower. It has been estimated that a mother has 30 per cent chance of transmitting the virus to her baby during pregnancy. The mortality rate among children with HIV is much higher compared to adults owing to their under-developed immune systems.However AP fared better or equally well in treating mothers to prevent transmission to children, as evinced by the data which shows that 1,142 HIV positive pregnant women were put on treatment.To reduce the numbers of baby transmissions, AP government in a first launched a new regimen of medication and treatment modality in 2012. The new treatment modality requires mothers to start treatment 14 weeks into pregnancy as against earlier practice of taking medication at the time of delivery. The medication now comprises a combination of three drugs as against one compound that was given earlier. Babies now are also given the same medication after birth. Additionally, under the new treatment practice, babies are screened every six months after birth until 18 months of age, when a concluding diagnosis is made about their infection.According to P L Jayachandra Reddy, additional project director of AP State Aids Control Society, more than 90 per cent of the first batch of pregnant women in undivided AP, who were put on the new treatment modality in 2012, delivered babies without infecting them.“The transmission rate has come down to about five per cent.

A dose of navirapine is given to mother at the time of delivery to prevent HIV transmission to child.According to NACO report, while 100% medical colleges and district hospitals have an HIV testing facility across the country, about 86% sub-district hospitals have the same.

""This is a surprising finding that provides new insights into our understanding of not only HIV infection, but also that of Ebola and other viruses,"" said Shan-Lu Liu, associate professor in the University of Missouri School of Medicine's Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology.AIDS is a condition characterised by progressive failure of the immune system. It is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).When HIV-1 or any virus infects a cell, it replicates and spreads to other cells. One type of cellular protein - T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain, or TIM-1 - has previously been shown to promote entry of some highly pathogenic viruses into host cells.Now, researchers have found that the same protein possesses a unique ability to block the release of HIV-1 and Ebola virus.""This study shows that TIM proteins keep viral particles from being released by the infected cell and instead keep them tethered to the cell surface,"" said Gordon Freeman, associate professor of medicine with Harvard Medical School's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.""This is true for several important enveloped viruses including HIV and Ebola. We may be able to use this insight to slow the production of these viruses,"" said Freeman.Under the supervision of Liu, Minghua Li, a graduate student in the MU Pathobiology Area Programme, performed a series of experiments that revealed the protein's ability to inhibit HIV-1 release, resulting in diminished viral production and replication.HIV-1 attacks cells that are vital to the body's immune system, such as T cells. These white blood cells play an important role in the body's response to infection, but HIV-1 disrupts the cells' ability to fight back against infection.When the virus enters a host cell, it infects the cell and replicates, producing viral particles that spread to and infect other cells.The researchers found that as the viral particles attempt to bud from, or leave, the infected cell, the TIM-family proteins located on the surface of the cell can attach to lipids on the surface of the viral particle.These lipids - known as phosphatidylserine (PS) - are normally present on the inner side of the cellular membrane but can be exposed to the outer side upon viral infection.When the TIM-family proteins come in contact with PS, the viral particle becomes attached to the host cell, keeping the particle from being released from the cell.Because TIM-family proteins and PS are present on the surface of the cell and the viral particle, the viral particles get stuck to one another, forming a network of viral particles that accumulate on the surface of the host cell, rather than being released to infect other cells.The study was published in the journal PNAS.","['hiv1', 'viral', 'release', 'ebola', 'hiv', 'cells', 'viruses', 'identified', 'proteins', 'particles', 'surface', 'host', 'inhibit', 'cell']","WASHINGTON: In a surprise finding, scientists have discovered that a family of proteins that helps viruses, such as HIV and Ebola, enter a cell can also block the release of these deadly viruses.

Shortly afterwards, her husband Binoy (name changed) also tested HIV-positive. Ever since, Binoy’s brother threatened the duo of dire consequences every now and then if they did not leave the house they shared with him.“My brother in-law used to abuse me maligning my character. For the last few years, I have not even shared the common washroom,” she said.“No amount of reasoning would convince him that we were taking all the necessary precautions since we also have a child. He and his wife would abuse and even physically assault us. Finally, on Saturday afternoon, my brother-in-law summoned a few locals who are known to him. After my husband returned from work, they caught hold of him and threw him out of the house. When I rushed to his rescue, one of them hit me on the head with a stick and I started bleeding,” she added.“But nobody in our locality was aware of our disease until yesterday. I am afraid how I will run my family now. I don’t know how our daughter will continue her education either.”The battered couple went to police, who helped them return home. There is now a police picket in the locality in Ghola. But the stigma of social ostracism in an area barely 30km from the city centre is a grim pointer to the taboo that still surrounds the disease.The couple have a six-year-old daughter, who is not HIV-positive. They were making preparations to secure her life when their own blood relatives and one-time friends turned on them. On Sunday, the couple brought back their daughter from an undisclosed location where they had sent her fearing her safety when they were attacked on Saturday.Local residents, however, came to the rescue of the couple. Basanti Malo, a member of Mahila Brindo Durga Puja Committee , said: “The shame will be on us and not them if we cannot stand by them at their hour of crisis. We plan to hand over some money to the couple by saving it from our Puja funds.”Pappu Roy, a local resident and a third-year student at APC College, said: “I will discuss with my friends how we can stand by them. We will have to first raise their confidence level so that they can live in the mainstream of the society without any sense of shame and fear. However, the question of how they will run their family and manage treatment costs is of utmost importance.”“The couple says they are HIV-positive and that they were beaten up by the husband's brother.

RAIPURAccording to officials, five ART centres that provide the drug free to HIV positive patients across the state have no stock of nevirapine syrup and tablets and some other medicines too could soon run out since no fresh stocks are coming in. Chhattisgarh Network for People Living with HIV said the shortage had exposed many to risks of the disease.Doctors revealed that pregnant women are supposed to receive a single dose of the drug at the time of labour and their newborn babies get a single dose of the drug syrup immediately after birth. ""Many babies in the state have missed this required dose, said president of Chhattisgarh Network of Positive People (CNPP), Rinki Arora.She said however, medicines- Tenofovir-lamivudine combination, which is prescribed to adults, and a lopinavir-ritonavir combination syrup that is given to children are available for next two months. However, they are apprehensive of yet another crises building up as it's already happened five times this year that stocks had run out.Talking to TOI, Rinki said she was in Delhi just to discuss the treatment strategy, as ART centres would soon be going out of stock of many medicines including tenofovir-lamivudine and lopinavir-ritonavir"". She said this is the big issue as drugs are necessary for the health of the mother and child.Secretary of CNPP, K Mukesh, said recently around 15 deliveries in Durg, 11 in Raipur and four in Bilaspur were conducted without the newborns being given the mandatory dose of nevirapine.

A similar trend has been observed among AIDS patients with only 51 cases registered in 2013 compared to 184 cases registered in 2009. A total of 1,040 persons have succumbed to the deadly virus since 1989, when HIV was first detected in Goa. But, this is only the reported figure, while the actual number would be higher as HIV-related deaths at home or private hospitals are not reflected in the above figures. GSACS project director Dr Vandana Patankar said that they have increased the number of anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centres in Goa. Earlier, there was only one main ART centre at the Goa medical college, Bambolim; but, in recent years, GSACS has set up link ART centres at Asilo hospital, Mapusa, Hospicio hospital, Margao, sub-district hospital, Ponda and cottage hospital, Chicalim.Patankar revealed plans of upgrading the link ART centre at the Hospicio, Margao, to facility-integrated ART centre. This means that there will be a doctor and nurse at the centre and patients from South Goa need not travel to GMC for the initial CD4 test. He also mentioned of another link ART centre that has been approved for the Curchorem community health centre.GSACS has tied up with nine NGOs to execute 16 projects in Goa to combat HIV/AIDS. These NGOs work with high risk groups like commercial sex workers, drug users, gay men, truckers, etc. GSACS is now adding two more projects with the focus on migrants.Another new measure is towards HIV positive pregnant women. Earlier, these women were treated only at the time of delivery. Now, such cases will be provided life-long ART treatment and the child will be given treatment for at least six months depending on whether it is HIV positive or negative. “Presently, the mother to child HIV transmission percentage is about 2.5%. We want to make it zero,” Patankar said.He also informed of another new initiative of setting up a new opiad substitution therapy centre at Hospicio, Margao. This centre is meant to wean drug addicts who use injections from syringes to oral drugs which are less addictive.

A genetic analysis of thousands of individual viruses has confirmed beyond reasonable doubt that HIV first emerged in Kinshasa, the capital of the Belgian Congo, in about 1920 from where it spread thanks to the colonial railway network to other parts of central Africa.Scientists have nailed the origin of the Aids pandemic to a colonial-era city — then called Leopoldville which was then the biggest urban centre in Central Africa including a market in wild “bush meat” captured from the nearby forests.A “perfect storm” of factors then led to the virus’ spread in the human population.UNAIDS estimates that 35 million people were living with HIV in the world at the end of 2013.Scientists from University of Oxford said, “Thirty years after the discovery of HIV-1, the early transmission, dissemination and establishment of the virus in human populations remain unclear. Using statistical approaches applied to HIV-1 sequence data from central Africa, we show that from the 1920s Kinshasa (in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo) was the focus of early transmission and the source of pre-1960 pandemic viruses elsewhere. Location and dating estimates were validated using the earliest HIV-1 archival sample, also from Kinshasa. Our results reconstruct the early dynamics of HIV-1 and emphasize the role of social changes and transport networks in the establishment of this virus in human populations.”Vendors sell their products beside a railroad track in Kinshasa, Zaire (File photo via Getty Images)The breakthrough was possible due to a new, sophisticated analysis of hundreds of genetic sequences of HIV from different time points and locations.The researchers also note that 13 documented cases exist of different simian viruses jumping from chimpanzees, gorillas and monkeys into humans, but only one — known has HIV-1 group M — sparked a global epidemic. They show that group M and another strain, group O, expanded at the same rate until about 1960, but then group M nearly tripled its rate of spread. Possible reasons include public health campaigns that had contaminated needles and an increase in the number of clients of sex workers.“For the first time we have analysed all the available evidence using the latest phylogeographic techniques, which enable us to statistically estimate where a virus comes from,” said Professor Oliver Pybus of Oxford University. “This means we can say with a high degree of certainty where and when the HIV pandemic originated.”“Kinshasa at that time was growing fast, it was the biggest city in central Africa at that time and was very well connected to the rest of the Congo,” said Nuno Faria of Oxford.“Data from colonial archives tells us that by the end of the 1940s over one million people were travelling through Kinshasa on the railways each year. Our genetic data tells us that HIV very quickly spread across Congo, a country the size of Western Europe,” Dr Faria said.“Our research suggests that following the original animal-to-human transmission of the virus, probably through the hunting or handling of bush meat , there was only a small window during the Belgian colonial era for this particular strain of HIV to emerge and spread into a pandemic,” Professor Pybus said.“By the 1960s, transport systems such as the railways that enabled the virus to spread vast distances were less active, but by that time the seeds of the pandemic were already sown across Africa and beyond,” he said.","['location', 'hiv1', 'kinshasa', 'pandemic', 'hiv', 'viruses', 'scientists', 'pinpointed', 'virus', 'spread', '30', 'congo', 'exact', 'central', 'appearance', 'hivs', 'group', 'africa']","LONDON: Over 30 years after it first emerged and has since infected over 75 million people, scientists have finally pinpointed from where exactly HIV emerged.

With diminishing stocks, patients were reported to be taking Nevirapine 50 mg four times in the morning and four times in the evening.“We cannot live without these drugs. The situation has been going on for a while. We are dependent on these medicines and a timely duration during the present course of the drug regimen keeps our health in check.

That child died four years ago, the home is now a big building closer to Acoi and presently, there are 20 girls and 22 boys living there. Except for seven, all are on anti-retroviral treatment from the Goa medical college. Most of the children are migrants but there are a few Goans from the Vasco area. ASRO takes in children of all creeds and most are non-Christians, except five.“There is a sad story behind every child here,” says Sr Coshav Rodrigues, in-charge of the home. “It is not their fault that they are HIV positive. Almost all of them got it from their parents.”But forget society, even family can be unforgiving. There is one 14-year-old girl from a well-to-do family, who lost both her parents to HIV/AIDS. When other family members realized she too was positive, they admitted her to ASRO. Once they took her home on a festival day but would not allow their daughter to play with her. When they returned the child to ASRO later in the evening, the child was in tears. And resolutely silent. With Sr Coshav’s gentle probing, the child opened up. The nun later counselled the family which relented and now take the child home for three or four days sometimes. “There is lot of misinformation among people. But they realize there is no danger when we tell them that we live with these children 24-hours in a day. We want to integrate them in society but the children live with rejection. Some express their hurt,” says Sr Felcy Lewis, who is also the resident nurse at the home.The oldest boy is 22-years old. He was admitted when he was around nine. He could not cope with studies and now works at the home. Except for the occasional cold, cough and fever, he keeps fairly good health. The youngest child is four years old who was admitted in June this year. She too is quite healthy. All children are taken for health check-ups to the GMC every month. But every six months, the children undergo blood tests at the GMC. In the last four years, only one child died at the home.Though the project is run by Caritas Goa, people donate generously in kind by giving rice, dal, coconut, sugar, milk, biscuits and bakery products. Occasionally, the home also gets chicken and fish.Waking up in the middle of the night to tend to a sick child is routine for the three nuns.

Additionally, there were 1,142 children whose parents were infected with the virus. The data used in the DCPCR study was gathered during the period April 2010-March 2012 from nine antiretroviral treatment centres, Children Affected by AIDS (CABA) pilot scheme and two institutions providing residential care to CABA in Delhi.The DCPCR study finds the coverage of the Financial Assistance Scheme for People Living with HIV/AIDS ((PLHA) of Delhi Government wanting in many ways. The scheme has so far enrolled 1,726 infected adults and children,14 orphan children who lost their parents to HIV/AIDS, 26 orphaned HIV-positive children and 12 HIV-positive destitute children.A sum of Rs 1,000 is given as monthly benefit to PLHAs including infected children, Rs 1,750 to orphaned children who are not positive but affected by HIV/AIDS as their parents were infected with the virus and Rs 2,050 to orphans and destitute children infected by HIV/AIDS under the scheme.However, the DCPCR study says there is need to reach out to more children. It is stated that the eligibility criteria are too complex for an affected person to fulfill. According to these, a PLHA has to be on one year of Anti Retroviral Treatment and has to provide proof of the same. Besides being a resident of Delhi for three years, the beneficiary must have an annual family income of less than Rs 1 lakh. In case of orphaned children there has to be proof of death of one or both parents due to HIV/AIDS. In case of a destitute child, proof of HIV positive status is mandatory. The child must also be found living in an institution in Delhi.

104,2-11-2014,['Rupali Mukherjee'],https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg,"A new study points to an alarmingly high burden of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) among HIV-positive patients at antiretroviral therapy (ART) centres, and provides evidence that primary transmission is the cause of DR-TB in as many as one in four newly-diagnosed TB patients.International medical humanitarian organisation Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) released the study published in PLoS One, which is the first to look at the DR-TB burden amongst attendees of ART centres in high HIV-burden settings in cities like Mumbai.Conducted in collaboration with the national health authorities in Mumbai between February 2013 and January 2014, attendees at seven large-scale ART centres were screened during more than 14,000 visits, and the sputum of 1,724 patients with TB symptoms was collected.The study reveals the proportion of DR-TB to be 25% among new cases of TB and 44% among previously treated TB cases. The findings reinforce the need for national health authorities to ensure timely diagnosis of DR-TB, especially for vulnerable populations and including people living with HIV, in order to curb primary transmission.What is alarming is, that it provides evidence that primary transmission is the cause of DR-TB in as many as one in four newly-diagnosed TB patients.Primary DR-TB results from the direct transmission of DR-TB from one person to another. The prevention of primary transmission of DR-TB has largely been neglected during the development of TB control programmes.These patients were exposed to DR-TB mycobacterium either in their communities or during their visits to health facilities as they have no previous records of receiving treatment for TB.“In ‘hot-spots’ such as the slums of Mumbai, and among vulnerable groups such as people living with HIV, the DR-TB epidemic may be driven by primary transmission, rather than simply by a lack of adherence to TB treatment,” says Dr Petros Isaakidis, MSF principal investigator of the study. “The government needs to pay more attention to primary transmission of DR-TB, particularly in settings of high HIV prevalence and rapid TB spread. Promptly diagnosing and treating DR-TB is the solution to curb primary transmission.”The data highlights the urgent need to address DR-TB among people living with HIV by systematically offering screening, drug susceptibility testing (DST) and access to treatment based on actual resistance patterns.“We need to urgently prevent transmission of DR-TB to others. With DR-TB, treatment is prevention, and these findings should lead to a stronger focus on diagnostics and treatment of DR-TB, particularly in high HIV-prevalent settings,” says Eldred Tellis of the Mumbai AIDS Forum. “This is in addition to the fact that health authorities cannot afford to neglect TB infection control in overcrowded healthcare facilities like ART centres.”“This study comes at the right time. Studies like this are complementary to the national survey and are essential to get a close-up picture of the DR-TB epidemic in ‘hot-spots’ and marginalised populations,” says Dr Arun Bamne, co-author of the study and former executive health officer of Mumbai’s Public Health Department. “Such studies will help shape the national response with specific interventions for those populations most at risk of getting DR-TB.”TB is one of the most common opportunistic infections and a leading cause of death among people living with HIV/AIDS. Undiagnosed and untreated drug-resistant tuberculosis is a major cause of mortality and morbidity among people living with HIV.In September, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan formally launched the first-ever nationwide TB drug-resistance survey to get a better understanding of the disease in the country.","['hiv', 'alarming', 'transmission', 'health', 'primary', 'study', 'treatment', 'national', 'drtb', 'burden', 'level', 'tb', 'highlights', 'living']","The findings reinforce the need for national health authorities to ensure timely diagnosis of DR-TB, especially for vulnerable populations and including people living with HIV, in order to curb primary transmission.What is alarming is, that it provides evidence that primary transmission is the cause of DR-TB in as many as one in four newly-diagnosed TB patients.Primary DR-TB results from the direct transmission of DR-TB from one person to another.

Nevertheless, they expressed concerns surrounding their mental health. Some complained of high levels of depression which they said followed after they had disclosed their sexual orientation. Changed behaviour of their family members, ridicule from peers and a sense of social rejection, said the interviewees, have taken a toll on their self-esteem.The interviewees also pointed out lack of privacy in state-run STI clinics (health centres which deal with sexually transmitted diseases). Once their sexual identity is disclosed, the homosexuals often face discrimination and harassment. This, some stated, forced them into alcohol or substance abuse. As a remedy, most stated that they preferred individual counseling.“When the society ridicules, having multiple partners becomes a desirable way to feel accepted. Unless they get help to come to terms and respect themselves, the sexual risk they face cannot be addressed.

The 35-year old youth patient, a resident of Rajnandgaon, the home constituency of chief minister Dr Raman Singh, who reportedly needs dialysis, has been denied treatment not only by private hospitals but also the state run premier institutes, Dr BR Ambedkar Memorial Hospital. The denial of treatment to the youth is a contravention of the apex court’s orders and the HIV AIDS bill 2007 that prohibits discrimination of a HIV/AIDS patient in several matters, including healthcare.According to sources, the youth was recently diagnosed with HIV at a private hospital in Raipur.

HOWRAH: Anwoman, who suffered injuries in a road accident, was allegedly turned down by two government hospitals in Howrah and Kolkata. Howrah District Hospital admitted her after a person intervened, but there she was allegedly kept overnight near the toilet of a ward, next to where a body was kept.When informed by TOI, the Howrah chief medical officer (health) expressed shock over the incident and said that he would get her admitted on Wednesday.On November 8, Babita Dolui (name changed), a resident of Ramrajatala, was travelling on a bicycle with her husband on Kona Expressway. The 32-year-old woman and her husband are masons and both of them were returning home from work .A speeding lorry knocked them down in Chatterjee Haat police station area. Babita fractured her right arm and cracked her spine, while her husband escaped with minor injuries. The police rushed her to Howrah District Hospital.“She was semi-conscious when she was taken to the hospital. Doctors and nurses at the hospital asked Babita’s husband whether she had any chronic disease. Her husband reportedly told them that she was HIV+. The doctors and nurses told my son-in-law that he also suffers from the “dirty” disease and they ought to lock him up. After hearing this, my son-in-law ran away. We came to know of the accident late in the evening. When we went to the hospital, Babita was lying on the floor and hadn’t been attended to. The doctors and nurses told us to take her away as they wouldn’t even touch her,” said Babita’s mother.The next day, Babita’s mother took her daughter to the Medical College and Hospital in Calcutta. The doctors there looked at the documents issued by the Howrah Hospital and told the elderly woman to take Babita away. “They told me that such patients can’t be treated there. They asked me to take her back home and wait for the injuries to heal naturally,” Babita’s mother added. When the woman produced a reference letter from local MLA Jatu Lahiri, a doctor allegedly retorted: “Who is the MLA to refer such a patient to us?”On Novermber 18, Babita’s mother informed the matter to their family friend Amit Goswami , who is a law clerk.Goswami then took her to Howrah District Hospital and insisted that they admit her. The hospital authorities assured Goswami that things would be taken care of.“Next morning, Babita was found lying on the floor next to the toilet of a ward. She said that a body had been kept on the floor beside her,” Babita’s mother said.","['away', 'hospital', 'told', 'hiv', 'doctors', 'babita', 'howrah', 'woman', 'positive', 'mother', 'shoo', 'hospitals', 'accident', 'nurses', 'babitas', 'husband', 'victim']","HIV positiveHOWRAH: Anwoman, who suffered injuries in a road accident, was allegedly turned down by two government hospitals in Howrah and Kolkata.

The dip among high-risk population however continues to be very marginal.For instance, the incidence fell from 0.61% in 2013 to mere 0.59% in 2014. Mumbai continues to be one of the high-risk districts within the state given the migration patterns. Over 2.30 lakh population, including 28,000 female sex workers, 19,000 men having sex with men and 1800 intravenous drug users, fall within this category.Dr Shrikala Acharya, additional project of Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) said that several steps are being taken to reach out to this population. “We are planning to open three new Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) at the Mumbai Port Trust. There will also be three mobile vans to facilitate testing among truckers,” she said. It is estimated that over 20,000 truckers halt in the city at any given year.MDACS, which is the nodal body to tackle HIV in the city, was itself reeling under a fund crunch till two weeks ago. They also had to take a loan of Rs8crore from the BMC to tide over the crunch. “It has not slowed down our activities. We are aiming at zero infection and discrimination,” she said. She added the body is adding two more antiretroviral centres to the existing dozen centres at Bhabha Hospital in Bandra and Rajawadi Hospital in Ghatkopar.Acharya added that the rates of mother-to-child transmission have also been steadily declining. From 1.10% in 2008-09 it has dropped to 0.25% in 2012-13. “The new multidrug regimen for prevention of HIV among newborns is working well,” she said.Around two years after the HIV epidemic hit home, the Maharashtra Aids Control Society (MSACS) has initiated a programme to trace patients who have been enrolled for care at some point. “Currently, at least 50,000 patients are lost to follow up, who may have died or migrated to other places.

A quick shave could be a close shave. Hundreds of roadside barbers in the city use just one razor or blade for shaving several customers. This means that with just a nick by an infected razor/blade, a customer can contract fatal infections like AIDS and Hepatitis B and C.Shockingly, there is no system or organization in the state or even across the country to check this unsafe practice. There are no checks on the barbers working at various public places, especially at railway stations, bus stands and government hospitals. Hundreds of customers unknowingly expose themselves to danger when they go to such barbers.Straight razors with open steel blades , also commonly known as cut-throats, were the mostThese roadside barbers can be seen at every nook and corner of the town using either straight razors with open steel blades, commonly known as cut-throats or disposable razors. They perform multiple shaves within a few minutes and do not bother to change the blade. What is more shocking is that even the persons who get themselves shaved do not ask for a new blade or a fresh razor.“I shave at least 20 people every day. My customers are generally passengers who do not halt in the city but have come for a meeting or an exam. They freshen-up at public toilets at the station, get a shave here and go off to work,” said Sanju, a barber at Agra Fort Railway Station.This barber was ferrying his equipment in a box and had placed his makeshift salon on his bicycle. Needless to say, there is no scope, even for sterilizing the equipment or razors.The barber when asked about his knowledge on HIV and AIDS, he said, “Ye sab to galat kaam karne se hota hai, dadhi banwane se nahi. Or Itna sochenge to khayenge kya (These things happen because of wrong acts and not because of shaving. If we will think that much, what will we eat).”He further asserted that he charges only Rs 3 from a shave. If he increases the rates, people will not come to him.Similarly, a barber working outside SN Medical College was seen using the same old blade to shave patients’ relatives. What are the precautions he takes? His refrain is, “I clean the razor with warm water before using it on other customer. We also sharpen the razor on stones whereby it gets cleaned automatically,” said Daddu, standing by his small salon on pavement.He also cited his meager income for not changing blades for each customer.According to doctors, this unsafe practice by barbers is simply not on the same page as the HIV and AIDS control department. No educational sessions or workshops have ever been conducted for the barbers, who are barely aware of the damger of using the same blade on multiple customers.“Prevention is the only viable way to control HIV spread, as there is no cure for the infection presently. The risk of infection spreading is low with razors, maybe two in 1,000 but nevertheless, it is advisable that only one with disposable blades should be used,” said Dr CP Singh, expert from the medicine department of SN Medical College.He added that the general perception is that HIV is transmitted through unsafe sex, infected blood transfusions and mother-to-child. These are the second and third highest reasons for HIV infections. But HIV infections can also be passed through sharing of non-sterile sharp instruments such as those used by barbers, incision, tattooing, ear perforation, blood-letting, injections and acupuncture. These too have always been classified as “other” reasons for spreading the infection and therefore given less attention in the campaign against the spread of HIV.“Though barbers do not carry out procedures that deliberately penetrate the skin but sometimes just a single mick or cut caused by the clipper or razor blade is enough for an infection to occur,” added Dr Singh.The doctors when asked how safe is to clean or wash the blade before using, he informed that due to the lipid envelope that protects HIV from dehydration, the virus can survive on the surfaces of barbering instruments for a period long enough for transmission to occur, particularly in commercial barber shops.Talking to TOI, chief medical officer HS Danu said there are no measures or laws to stop this roadside barbering practice all across UP. This is an ethical responsibility of the district administration and civic body to issue no licenses to these roadside barbers.“But these days, they do not even halt at roadside. They ferry their salon on bycycles and its impossible to check such practices,” added the CMO.","['razor', 'barber', 'shave', 'hiv', 'razors', 'infection', 'blade', 'roadside', 'barbers', 'using', 'customers', 'expose']","AGRA: Even after spending crores in creating HIV and AIDS awareness, the precautions that must be taken against the deadly infection hinge on a razor’s edge.

It also promises relief to patients from severe side effects caused by drugs prescribed under ART.HIV-AIDS patients would be put on fixed dose therapy (FDT) in which a single pill would be given in place of three drugs that cause side effects and will reduce pressure on kidney and liver.Speaking with TOI ahead of the world HIV AIDS Awareness Day, Indian Society of Haemetology and Blood Transfusion president A K Tripathi said, “FDT will soon be introduced across all ART centers across UP. In King George's Medical University it will be launched in mid-December.”The single pill, often referred to as the wonder drug in AIDS treatment, comprises three medicines given as first line of treatment. Also, salts used in them are better than the previous formula. One of these three (stavudine) was known to cause lipid abnormalities and neuropathy. As a result, fat deposits occur in the patient’s body in specific places while it dries up in other (lipodystrophy) leading to severe disfigurement. Blood cholestrol levels also go up posing risk to heart health and causing burning sensation in hands and feet. Stavudine has been replaced with tenofovir.The other salt called nevirapine had three major side effects, including damage to liver, severe allergic reaction and interference in treatment of tuberculosis. This salt has been replaced with effavirenz. The third medicine called lamivudine has been retained as it is.A policy decision to this effect was taken in May 2013 and was implemented later. It is now being launched in UP. “Side effects tend to compel patients to skip medicines, which compromises the adherence rate. Success of the aids control programme cannot be guaranteed unless adherence rate is above 90% which the wonder drug helps achieve,” explained Dr Tripathi.Besides introducing this drug, National Aids Control Organisation has introduced changes in the treatment guidelines which promise better success of the programme. One of them, which relates to pregnant women, says they should all be tested for HIV AIDS and if found positive, should be put on ART irrespective or the CD4 count reading.It may be noted that CD4 count is the parameter for putting a patient on ART. Till 2013 a CD4 count of 250 made an HIV-positive person eligible for ART. After a revised order, a CD4 count of 350 meant clearance for ART. The new guidelines also overlook CD4 count for HIV positive persons diagnosed of TB.","['aids', 'hiv', 'cd4', 'pills', 'drug', 'patients', 'treatment', 'count', 'cut', 'art', 'severe', 'therapy', 'effects', 'dose', 'launched']","Lucknow: A new protocol for management of HIV AIDS will be launched across AAL anti-retro-viral therapy (ART) centers across UP reducing the number of pills from three to one.

However, inconsistency in supplies and frequent stock outs of lifesaving HIV medicines in government owned centres in major cities like Delhi, Mumbai and the northeast have the potential to put India back in the danger zone, experts warn.“Once a patient starts the therapy, medicine needs to be taken daily with proper adherence, or else the drugs quickly lose their effectiveness. Once this happens, HIV patients have to switch to a second line of treatment which is five times more expensive than first-line drugs, adding an additional burden on our healthcare system,” said Daisy David, advocacy officer, World Vision India.Moreover, there is also a severe dearth of testing kits like CD4 and viral load, which are crucial for patients to monitor the virus and ascertain the stage of infection. “These tests are important because they help a doctor ascertain when to change the line of treatment for particular patients. In the absence of these tests, a patient may develop resistance to a certain medicine or line of treatment and hence develop the virus again,” said Vikas Ahuja, president of Delhi Network of Positive People, a trust that works with HIV/AIDS patients. WHO ) report last year said the Indian government was providing free anti-retroviral drugs for treating HIV since 2004, but only 50% of those eligible were getting it in 2012.According to Anand Grover, founder-president of Lawyers Collective, a faulty procurement policy, withdrawal of global funding from India and other middle income countries and discrimination with the vulnerable population including sex workers and drug addicts were major causes leading to such problems.The health ministry recently told Lok Sabha that though there were shortages, it had resolved the issue for the time being by procurement and donations from a domestic pharmaceutical company. The ministry has also initiated a computerized supply chain management system for assessment of drug requirement and their stocks.The latest data from National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) shows there are over 2.09 million HIV patients in India, with the north, south and northeast regions accounting for the majority of patients. The government receives nearly $80 million from the Global Fund, an international aid organisation for HIV prevention and treatment.The United Nations estimates India currently has the third largest population of people living with HIV in the world. However, NACO data shows a significant decline in prevalence of HIV among adults across the country. At national level, prevalence was estimated at 0.41% in 2001, whereas it dropped to 0.35% in 2006 and 0.27% in 2011, latest data with the department showed.Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director, WHO South-East Asia, said stigma, discrimination and restrictive laws continued to be barriers to accessing prevention, care and treatment services. “The HIV epidemic in our region is concentrated among populations most vulnerable to HIV: men who have sex with men, transgender people, people who inject drugs, sex workers, people in prisons and other closed settings. Although we have been successful in scaling up the health sector response for the vulnerable populations, more needs to be done. Less than 50% of these people know their HIV status,” she said.Though the government is hopeful the HIV and AIDS bill, drafted in 2006, which was tabled in the Rajya Sabha in February and is currently being considered by a parliamentary standing committee, will address most of these issues, Grover said even the draft bill keeps people with HIV and AIDS out of the purview of free medicines.“Just by ignoring the issue, the government cannot tackle the real menace of the disease. It needs to guarantee access to medicines for all,” Grover said.","['aids', 'hiv', 'sex', 'patients', 'test', 'world', 'workers', 'treatment', 'hits', 'medicines', 'scarcity', 'india', 'therapy', 'vulnerable', 'kit', 'drugs']","“These tests are important because they help a doctor ascertain when to change the line of treatment for particular patients.

A cause for alarm is that though the number of HIV infections has decreased this year as compared to the last, the number of HIV patients has increased.From January to October this year, Goa registered 128 cases of non-Goans among the total 376 cases registered across the state. During the corresponding period of last year, the figure was 86 of the total 386 cases registered by October 2013.Though the disease surfaced in Goa in 1987 when a foreigner was detected HIV positive with the second case being of a non-Goan in 1988, Goa has so-far registered 15,603 HIV positive persons. While Goa has registered 1,662 full-blown AIDS cases up to October, a total of 1,041 patients have lost their lives to AIDS by September this year, states data prepared by the Goa State AIDS Control Society (GSACS).According to data gathered by GSACS, HIV infection is now prevalent in all parts of Goa. What is worrying is that in Goa, HIV is not confined to coastal belts, but has penetrated to other areas, too. The disease is no longer an urban phenomenon, but has spread to rural areas as well. The HIV prevalence is shifting its base from one taluka to other, every year.In 2013, the majority of the cases was reported in the four coastal talukas: Salcete (18.4%), Mormugao (12.8%) in south Goa district and Tiswadi (11.5%) and Bardez (14.9%) in north Goa district during 2013.But, by October 2014, Tiswadi in the north showed a marginal decrease with 5.3% prevalence, while Bardez in the same district has shown a rise of about 2.7% (16.2% in 2014). In South Goa, Salcete has shown a decline of 4.3%. The taluka has noted 14.1% prevalence as against 18.4% of last year and Mormugao a decline of 2.7%. Last year, HIV prevalence in this taluka was 12.8% which has decreased to 10.1% this year, GSACS statistic stated. Dr Vandana Patankar, project director, GSACS, claimed that a large floating population in Goa has contributed to the bulging figure of HIV-infected in the state.People migrating to Goa from other Indian states raises the figure. The state has noted a spread of the disease largely by the sexual mode. While the state has a thriving drug trade on its coastal belts, there were very less number of people found affected with passing on the needles used for injecting narcotic drugs, she admitted.“Besides, most of the people from other Indian states come to Goa to get their blood sample checked as Goa has better facilities than other states,” Patankar said.She also said that Goa has proper counseling, awareness-raising measures, accurate testing facilities across the state and anti-retroviral treatment (ART) center at Goa medical college and hospital, Bambolim. There are 3,476 people including 1,962 males, 1,327 females, 183 children below the age of 14 years and four transgenders have registered for the ART, statistics point out.","['registered', 'nongoans', 'hiv', 'prevalence', 'patients', 'states', '30', 'taluka', 'cases', 'total', 'state', 'goa', 'number', 'gsacs']","PONDA:With a large number of migrants pouring into Goa, the HIV epidemic is turning into a frightening reality as the state has registered about 30 percent cases of HIV infection among non-Goans including people from other states and foreigners.

However, a study conducted by Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), an international NGO, says many a kala-azar patient are HIV positive, but are ignorant about it. Non-treatment of HIV weakens their immunity system, due to which even VL drugs do not show proper effect and are leading to relapse of VL. Incidentally, Bihar accounts for over 90% kala-azar (VL) cases in the world.The study published in an issue of an international journal, Clinical Infectious Diseases, says out of over 2,000 kala-azar patients screened in Hajipur, 117 were HIV positive. Only 68 of them had prior knowledge of it. The prevalence of VL-HIV was much higher in males (71.4%) than females (28.6%).It may be mentioned here that another study published in August 2014 in Public Library of Science ( PLOS ) had said that estimated chances of VL relapse in HIV positive people was over 25% after three years of treatment of kala-azar. The mortality rate of VL-HIV cases are also high. Even after four years of treatment of VL, 30% HIV-VL patients could not survive. There are also a couple of studies to suggest that early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV positive had bettered the results of VL treatment too.These figures should be alarming because, according to an estimate, over 3 lakh people have HIV/AIDS in Bihar. The PLOS study says that the risk of developing VL in HIV positive people is 100-2300 times higher compared to non-HIV people. It added, “Screening for VL in HIV cases living in VL-endemic areas must also be encouraged.”Experts say HIV test must become a part of protocol to treat VL. National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) had been assigned the task of developing guidelines to this effect in the road map released to eliminate VL by the then Union health minister, Dr Harsh Vardhan. While the state government still awaits any such guidelines, state programme officer M P Sharma said, “As of now, there is no plan to include HIV testing in the VL treatment protocol. At present, we are concentrating on the guidelines given by the Centre.”There is another issue of dosage of drugs. Recently, AmBisome (single dose treatment for VL) was launched in the state. However, experts say single dosage does not work well in HIV-VL patients. Dr Gaurab Mitra, who was one of the researchers of the study and works with MSF, told TOI, “Instead of giving it in one dose, we divide it into six doses. We believe and recommend the same in government protocol too.”His argument also finds support in the study mentioned in PLOS.

In accordance with the goals of United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS or UNAIDS , India is also aiming for ‘Zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination, zero AIDS-related deaths’. Dr Khaparde is optimistic about these goals being achieved in the years to come.“Initially, parent to child transmission (PPTC) was the cause of 27% of new HIV cases, which was brought down to 7% through various targeted interventions. At present, this rate is 1%. Every year, there is a cohort population of 29 million women we wish would undergo testing for HIV and syphilis. Unfortunately, due to healthcare not being accessible to all, not even half of this population is covered,” he said.The problems in the way of universal HIV testing of pregnant women include the infrastructure and staff being unavailable at levels below the district. “We are trying to tackle this problem by training nurses, non-medical staff and, if possible, even accredited social health activists (ASHA), in villages to test and counsel all pregnant women. Efforts are also being made to scale up programmes and infrastructure at community health centres and primary health centres with the aim of reaching all possible pregnant mothers in time,” said Dr Khaparde.As most other health issues, better treatment of HIV also requires contribution of the society. “We see that even today, there is many stigmas attached to the infection, from the general community and sometimes even healthcare professionals, that several patients hesitate to ask for help. On the level of governance, we have done much awareness generation,” he said. Dr Khaparde adds that the ministry of health and family welfare has even enlisted the help of other relevant ministries like education, social welfare, industry, etc to spread awareness about HIV-AIDS.","['drop', 'women', 'hiv', 'health', 'transmission', 'dr', 'pregnant', '57', 'cases', 'community', 'major', 'zero', 'success', 'welfare', 'khaparde']","NAGPURIndia may rank second in the world in terms of number of People Living with HIV (PLHIV) (more than 20 lakh).

Tamil Nadu recorded 26,089 fresh cases in 2010-11, which reduced to 9,892 in 2013.The sharp decrease in the number of cases follows increased awareness among people about screening and precautions, said experts. “Tamil Nadu has a strong health system which focused on meticulous screening for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

The state government along with NGOs has reached villages for HIV screening,” said A Bakthavatchalam, deputy director, Association for Rural Mass India, an NGO.The state government and NGOs introduced a number of schemes to reach more people. “One scheme was to adopt 100 villages and engage into one-to-one conversations with people. Based on the conversations, we would test them for HIV,” said S Kalaiarasi, executive director, Swestic, an NGO that identifies and monitors people with HIV in five districts in Tamil Nadu.Kalairasi said awareness about methods of prevention has increased among risk-prone communities like the transgenders, homosexuals and sex workers. “Five years ago, a sex worker, especially in rural areas, would agree to sex without protection. Today, most sex workers insist on condoms and sometimes even explain the reason to the customer,” she said.Compulsory screening in certain areas has also helped reduce the number of cases. “An NGO would map a district based on the cases and list high-risk villages. In some cases, based on analysis, NGOs would insist on compulsory screening,” said Bakthvatchalam. “This was to help people get medical attention if they were in the initial stages.”Experts and NGOs attribute the higher screening rate to funding from and programmes by corporate and private bodies. “Over the years, besides the central and state government efforts, we have seen corporates and private bodies organizing screening camps and awareness, especially in the southern states,” said Raman.While Tamil Nadu is seeing sharp reduction in the number of fresh cases every year, the overall numbers are still high.

Concerned over his condition, his family took him to a psychiatrist. On the advice of the shrink, his family then took him to a government ICTC (Integrated counselling and testing centre) for a HIV re-testing. This time, much to the relief of everyone, the man is found HIV negative. But it was only after enduring the trauma for a month.District medical and health officials said despite the government mandate of conducing three tests for confirming HIV positive cases, most private centres conduct a single test, which can be misleading as it is done without pre- and post-test counselling.“There have also been cases where people committed suicide or were taken ill after being declared HIV positive. Thanks to the single test carried out in most private centres for HIV testing, which often leads to wrong diagnosis,” stated Dr Ronanki Ramesh, additional district medical and health officer ( AIDS and leprosy).“To confirm whether a person is HIV positive, a series of three blood tests need to be done in half-an-hour, including Coombs, SD bioline and Sigma tests. There are also other types of test kits such as Quickcheck, Elisa, Western Blot Tests as prescribed by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

The Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RSACS) is taking measures to increase the number of tests for HIV among pregnant women.There are 20% home births where they don’t lend an ear to the need of getting tested for HIV. According to health department officials, the institutional deliveries have increased significantly up to 80% but still 20% remain home-based deliveries.An RSACS official said, “In institutional deliveries, the chances of HIV transmission from mother to child reduces to 2-3% if universal precaution of delivery and proper medicines to prevent the transmission of HIV are taken. Also, such mothers should not breastfeed their babies.”There are 18 lakh pregnancies reported every year in the state. In 2013-14, RSACS tested 4.68 lakh pregnant women for HIV with their consent. Among them, 412 were tested positive for HIV and there was a risk of transmission from mother to child. In 2012-13, the RSACS had tested 3.86 lakh pregnant women and found 383 of them living with HIV.Three years have passed but a 25-year-old Usha’s (name changed) tears still trickle down when she remembers the moment her newly born baby was declared tested positive for HIV.She was a resident of Jharkhand before she was married to a resident of the city. “I came to know that I am HIV positive at the time of my son’s birth. He was born in a government hospital in Jaipur three years ago. When doctors tested him for HIV, they informed me that he is born with HIV infection. Now, like me, he is also taking medicines for the infection,” said Usha on the eve of World AIDS Day.

Anti-HIV crusaders fear that substandard quality of free condoms alone can push up HIV prevalence.Over the last few months, cash-strapped NGOs and community-based organisations (CBO) have raised the issue of inferior quality condoms with government agencies.A Malad-based CBO has often written to National Aids Control Organisation ( NACO ), that inferior quality of condoms has rendered its distribution among transgenders useless. “Our workers are ridiculed for distributing condoms, which lack proper lubrication,” said Gauri Sawant of the CBO.Quality assumes importance in Mumbai which has nearly 2.50lakh people in the high-risk zone and vulnerable to contract the infection. “Condom distribution is key to curbing infection among men having sex with men and female sex workers,” said Ashok Row Kavi founder of Humsafar Trust. “Super-lubricated condoms are not that useful. We must provide regular condoms with extra lubrication,” he said.While NGOs are supposed to get 80% of condom supply from NACO, they are expected to forge ties with manufacturers to arrange for the remaining 20%. NGOs say due to payment issues they hardly manage to get private firms interested in supplying them.For NGOs working with female sex workers, it becomes a dual challenge. “It takes a lot of persuasion for a sex worker to convince a client to use a condom. The least NACO can ensure is to provide good quality condoms,” said a CBO working with female sex workers.NACO refused knowledge of quality concerns. “There have been problems with supply, which will be streamlined soon. But we haven’t been told of quality issues,” said a senior official.","['drive', 'hiv', 'sex', 'workers', 'condom', 'ngos', 'flaccid', 'naco', 'condoms', 'female', 'cbo', 'infection', 'makes', 'quality']","MUMBAI: At a time when the HIV campaign is steering towards ‘zero new infection’, its prevention among high-risk groups in the city hangs between bad quality of condoms and complete unavailability of the same.

Estimates by National Aids Control Organization ( NACO ), which works under the ministry of health and family welfare, show over 22 million people were tested during 2013-14, of which 2,40,234 people were found HIV positive. This included over 12,000 pregnant women who were diagnosed with the virus.“The low level of awareness among HIV positive population is of concern because research shows that early diagnosis is crucial. It allows patients to start on treatment sooner, which can greatly reduce the risk of spreading the infection to partners. Detecting the virus early also improves health outcomes for infected patients,” said Gerald Schochetman, senior director, Infectious Diseases and Diagnostic Research, Abbott.Government officials as well as health experts say the risk is more among the vulnerable population that practises high risk behaviour or have higher chances of HIV prevalence. This includes sex workers, trans-genders and even long-distance truckers.Over the years, counselling and testing centres across the country have increased with many private laboratories now offering HIV detection tests apart from the government centres. In 1997, there were just 67 HIV testing and counselling sites in India, whereas NACO data shows there over 15,000 healthcare facilities offering counselling and testing across the country in 2014.“Counselling and testing services are important components of prevention and control of AIDS in the country,” said Anand Grover, founder-president of Lawyers Collective. Grover said instead of cutting corners with the vulnerable population by criminalizing them, government should counsel and provide them with proper care so that they do not transmit the disease further.“In the past few years, the number of infections has declined in India because we worked with the vulnerable population, distributed condoms and made them aware. One needs to partner them so that they help in not increasing the burden,” Grover said.The UN estimates that India currently has the third largest population of HIV infected people in the world.

HIV is evolving to become less deadly and less infectious, according to a major scientific study led by British scientists.The team at the University of Oxford has shown that it was taking longer for HIV infection to cause AIDS The rapid evolution of HIV, which has allowed the virus to develop resistance to patients’ natural immunity is at the same time slowing the virus’s ability to cause AIDS.The study also indicates that people infected by HIV are likely to progress to AIDS more slowly — in other words the virus becomes less virulent — because of widespread access to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Both processes make an important contribution to the overall goal of the control and eradication of the HIV epidemic.Scientists said: “Twenty years ago the time to AIDS was 10 years, but in the last 10 years in Botswana that might have increased to 12.5 years. One might imagine as time extends this could stretch further and further and in the future people being asymptomatic for decades.”In 2013, there were a total of 35 million people living with HIV worldwide according to the World Health Organization.The study was led by researchers at the University of Oxford, along with scientists from South Africa, Canada, Tokyo, Harvard University and Microsoft Research Schoolgirls take part in an HIV/AIDS awareness rally on World AIDS Day at a School in Patiala, on December 1, 2014.Lead scientist Professor Phillip Goulder from the University of Oxford, said: “This research highlights the fact that HIV adaptation to the most effective immune responses we can make against it comes at a significant cost to its ability to replicate. Anything we can do to increase the pressure on HIV in this way may allow scientists to reduce the destructive power of HIV over time.”Bill Clinton, former US president, addresses the crowd at a musical concert organized to spread awareness about HIV/AIDS on World AIDS day in New York City, on December 1, 2014.The research was carried out in Botswana and South Africa, two countries that have been worst affected by the HIV epidemic. Across those countries, researchers enrolled over 2000 women with chronic HIV infection to take part in the study.The first part of the study looked at whether the interaction between the body’s natural immune response and HIV leads to the virus becoming less virulent.Central to this investigation are proteins in our blood called the human leukocyte antigens (HLA), which enable the immune system to differentiate between the human body's proteins and the proteins of pathogens. People with a gene that expresses a particular HLA protein called HLA-B57 , are known to benefit from a protective effect to HIV.Infected patients with the HLA-B57 gene progress more slowly than usual to AIDS.College and Schoolstudents hold a giant red ribbon made by themselves during an event to raise awareness of HIV/AIDS on the World AIDS Day, in Fuyang, China, on December 1, 2014.This study showed that in Botswana, where HIV has evolved to adapt to HLA-B57 more than in South Africa, patients no longer benefit from this gene’s protective effect.However, the team’s data show that the cost of this adaptation to HIV is that its ability to replicate is significantly reduced, therefore making the virus less virulent.The authors show that viral adaptation to protective gene variants, such as HLA-B57, is driving down the virulence of transmitted HIV and is thereby contributing to HIV elimination.In the second part of the study the authors examined the impact of ART on HIV virulence. They developed a mathematical model, which concluded that selective treatment of people with low CD4 counts will accelerate the evolution of HIV variants with a weaker ability to replicate.","['aids', 'research', 'edge', 'hiv', 'losing', 'virus', 'form', 'world', 'hlab57', 'university', 'ability', 'study', 'evolving', 'finds', 'milder', 'south']","LONDON: One of the world’s most feared virus is losing its edge.

Some regions in the country continue to record a large number of HIV cases, which is why the national average still shows a positive trend on a graph. Until the national average comes to stagnation, a reverse trend is almost impossible. The migration of citizens will continue to spread the infection,” said Marfatia.According to Dr Mohammed Hussain, who handles HIV patients at SSG Hospital, transmission of the virus still continues at considerable rate. “There still remains a section across the social strata of the population that do not go for regular check-ups. HIV virus can stay in the human body without causing any trouble for years, but the infection can be transmitted to another person,” he added.The study conducted by Marfatia suggests that nearly 68 per cent of spouses get infected because the disease was never detected in their partners. “Heterosexual intercourse is the commonest route of HIV transmission in India. The unaffected spouse could incur the infection for two basic reasons – either the infected person is unaware of the infection or the infected person deliberately hides the information,” added Marfatia.Sixty-six HIV positive patients and their partners from in and around the city were studied during the research project. The study concluded showed that unprotected sex between spouses remains a major cause of HIV transmission.“The transmission of HIV and AIDS due to blood transfusion or reused syringe has gone down to almost zero per cent. Multiple sex partners and unprotected sex remains the major cause now. People have to understand that regular check-ups and discussing about AIDS can solve the problem to a great extent,” Marfatia said.","['partners', 'way', 'shows', 'long', 'hiv', 'sex', 'virus', 'spread', 'transmission', 'person', 'stagnant', 'study', 'remains', 'infection', 'decline']","Some regions in the country continue to record a large number of HIV cases, which is why the national average still shows a positive trend on a graph.

Earlier, local people had allegedly drove her husband to commit suicide by taunting him repeatedly for his HIV Positive status and threatening eviction.A “nexus” between local landsharks, the councillor’s husband and the former land owner of the house allegedly conspired to evict the woman by instigating neighbours to banish the “morally corrupt” woman from the area.She and her children were dragged out of the house on November 23 and the door was padlocked. The trio has since been spending the nights either at a railway platform or with relatives who allowed them only one night’s stay.The woman has been running from pillar to post in search of help from the administration, only to be refused everywhere. “I told police officials everything and requested them to make an arrangement for my children and me to return home. But, nobody took the matter seriously.

The elder one is 14-year-old and studies in Class IX, while the younger one is six-year-old and a student of Class II. The house is in ward No. 13 of Kamarhati Municipality. Her husband, who was a grocer, had committed suicide in May after being hounded by neighbours following the HIV Positive diagnosis during tests prior to a brain tumor operation. The woman was thereafter asked to undergo a check and she too tested positive.“After the initial shock, I took it bravely and went through the entire process of medication and counselling at RG Kar Hospital . I decided to keep my condition under wraps when doctors said we could lead a normal life under medication and care. I looked forward to life as my two sons were not infected.

The state has earned the dubious third position after Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat to report this alarming trend, raising a serious question over the quality of blood transfused to unsuspecting patients.The shocking disclosure comes at a time when the HIV-fighting agencies have had people believe that transfusion-transmitted infection has almost been eliminated. The RTI response showed that between April and October 2014, around 629 people across the country, including 80 in the state, got HIV through blood transfusion. The cumulative count for the past five years is 8,983 people who got HIV through blood transfusion in India.The data collected from Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) through voluntary disclosure of clients, though, has raised a storm among the HIV-fighting agencies at the state and the Centre. While officials have questioned its veracity, activists insist the numbers expose the glaring lack of accountability when it comes to ensuring quality of blood supplied by blood banks. Interestingly, nodal agencies such as the State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC) and the Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS) have put the onus on each other to ensure blood banks play by the rule and detect every HIV case.Experts say a fundamental problem is the fact that HIV in most blood banks is still tested through enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay test (ELISA) that has an innate shortcoming. “If a person has recently contracted HIV, this test may not show. It can detect HIV antibodies that take a minimum of three months to show in the blood. So if a person donates blood, it will end up getting transfused,” said an ICTC staffer from Parel’s KEM Hospital.“Due to financial constraints, most blood banks have not graduated to advanced tests such as nuclear acid testing (NAT) that cut down the HIV detection window period from few months to a week,” said Vinay Shetty of NGO Think Foundation. Currently, only a handful of the city’s leading private hospitals offer NAT-tested blood, which again comes at a premium fee of at least Rs 1,200 per unit. “None of the state-run and BMC blood banks, however, have this facility,” he said.In an RTI response, has revealed that nearly 1,000 people contracted the human immunodeficiency (HIV) virus in Maharashtra due to transfusion of infected blood over the past five years.In fact, there is also a worrying amount of negligence while conducting and then screening blood, said a senior technician from a leading blood bank. “Any person who tests positive for HIV during a donation camp is seldom informed about his status or referred to an ICTC centre, although both are mandatory. Therefore, that person goes about donating several times till he is detected at some point,” said the technician, adding that several youngsters, in fact, bank on blood camps to find out about their status. “Once they do not get follow-up calls, they go about things normally,” he added.Officials from the SBTC, though, feel the numbers are not that bad given that there are 11 lakh donations on an average annually. “How much can we trust voluntary disclosures by people who may be unwilling to disclose how they actually contracted the virus? Also, SBTC’s role is to ensure blood is available for everyone. The infection part is dealt with by MSACS,” said Dr Sanjay Jadhav, director, State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC).MSACS, on the other hand, said it is SBTC that monitors all activities of blood banks. “The information on number of people infected with HIV due to infected blood transfusion is not available with us. There is an option of recording the mode of transmission of HIV for clients being tested at ICTC. However, there are no means to verify this,” said Khushalsinh Pardeshi, project director, MSACS. The bickering between the agencies also highlights how none of them may be actively monitoring the number of HIV infections happening through the transfusion route.According to MSACS data, annual new HIV infections in Maharashtra have reduced from 10,431 in 2007 to 5,893 in 2011 while there has been a 49% decline in AIDS related deaths.","['infected', 'ictc', 'hiv', 'blood', 'person', 'msacs', 'maharashtra', 'cases', 'banks', 'transfusion', 'state', '1000']","MUMBAI: The National Aids Control Organisation , in an RTI response, has revealed that nearly 1,000 people contracted the human immunodeficiency ( HIV ) virus in Maharashtra due to transfusion of infected blood over the past five years.

As Mahesh and some other inmates of Anandaghar, run by Organisation for Friends, Energies & Resources (OFFER), step into adulthood, they aspire to stand on their own feet. They hope vocational and skill development training that OFFER has been giving along with formal education could help them earn a living.“We fought the resistance in admitting them in schools because of their ‘HIV positive’ status. In addition, we have also been providing vocational training to older children so that this would help them in future.

Currently there are 70 such children at the home that provides, apart from food and shelter, education along with clinical care for HIV. But the organization is now staring at a bigger task — rehabilitating the children who are 18 years and above by getting them placement— in a rare initiative to get such children back in mainstream.Bajoria Charitable Foundation (BCF) that has been supporting OFFER is also keen on this rehabilitation project. BCF founder Namit Bajoria, who runs a kitchen appliances chain Kutchina, intends to identify skills in these children and improve them before placing them in jobs.“To begin with, we can place some of them in back office or in outlets in the city. As and when they learn the job they could be given bigger responsibility. The aim is not only financial assistance, but to make these children part of the mainstream society,” says Namit Bajoria.At OFFER these children are being trained at skills like computer operation, bakery and house-keeping etc. OFFER has started approaching corporate houses and other organisations to tie up for the rehabilitation project. But apart from Kutchina and a handful of MNCs, the response has not been very encouraging.The prospect of earning bread and butter on their own is already a reason for excitement for the likes of Pratik Sarkar.

Once inside a host, these strains can recombine into a new variant of the virus, researchers said.One such recombinant variant observed in patients in Cuba appears to be much more aggressive than other known forms of HIV, researchers said. Before it can enter human cells, HIV must first anchor itself to them. The virus does this via anchor points, or co-receptors, which are proteins on the cell membrane.In a normal infection, the virus first uses the anchor point CCR5. In many patients, after a number of healthy years, the virus then switches to the anchor point CXCR4. This co-receptor switch coincides with a faster progression to AIDS.Researchers at KU Leuven's Laboratory for Clinical and Epidemiological Virology in Belgium have described a recombinant form of HIV observed in patients in Cuba that makes this transition much faster. The virus targets the anchor point CXCR4 early after infection, shortening drastically the healthy phase and triggering rapid progression to AIDS.The transition from anchor point CCR5 to CXCR4 is normally very difficult. Researchers suspect that the rapid transition observed in this HIV recombinant occurs as a result of combining fragments from different HIV subtypes.","['aids', 'anchor', 'point', 'hiv', 'virus', 'form', 'patients', 'cxcr4', 'transition', 'observed', 'aggressive', 'accelerates', 'researchers', 'recombinant']","LONDON: A new aggressive form of HIV can progress to AIDS in just three years - so rapidly that patients may not even realize they were infected, scientists say.Engaging in unprotected sex with multiple partners increases the risk of contracting multiple strains of HIV.

As TOI checked with some counsellors, who carry out these free tests, there is acute shortage of these kits as well as of gloves, syringes and vacuum tubes. Those from the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community and sex workers are fearful that, since no tests are being conducted, there can be a rise in HIV/AIDS cases among them.Ravi, an NGO employee working with gay and bisexual men, says members of this community must go for the tests every six months. “The counsellor at Aruna Asaf Ali Hospital said there are no kits. When we went to Welcome Colony’s ICTC, it was the same. While we were waiting outside the counsellor’s room, two pregnant women got the tests done. When we confronted her, she said that only one kit was available and pregnant women are their priority,” he said.At the Kashmere Gate ICTC, Mallika, a transgender, was twice denied the test for the same reason. Herself an activist, Mallika is worried as “convincing transgenders to take the tests is very difficult. Now, with no kits, the disease will only spread. When we asked the counsellors, they said there is shortage at the government level”. Some members of the community are convinced that the government has intentionally pulled the plug from the programme. “My partner and I are experiencing symptoms of HIV. We are both very anxious and now kits aren’t available. I think the government is looking for ways to finish off the community,” Kunal, who went to Hindu Rao Hospital for the test but had to return without it done, said.

Researchers found that the new drug candidate blocks every strain of HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus) that has been isolated from humans or rhesus macaques, including the hardest-to-stop variants. It also protects against much-higher doses of virus than occur in most human transmission and does so for at least eight months after injection.“Our compound is the broadest and most potent entry inhibitor described so far,” said Michael Farzan, from the Florida campus of The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI). When HIV infects a cell, it targets the CD4 lymphocyte, an integral part of the body’s immune system. HIV fuses with the cell and inserts its own genetic material and transforms the host cell into a HIV manufacturing site.The new study builds on previous discoveries by the Farzan laboratory, which show that a co-receptor called CCR5 contains unusual modifications in its critical HIV-binding region, and that proteins based on this region can be used to prevent infection.Farzan and his team developed the new drug candidate so that it binds to two sites on the surface of the virus simultaneously, preventing entry of HIV into the host cell.“When antibodies try to mimic the receptor, they touch a lot of other parts of the viral envelope that HIV can change with ease,” said TSRI Research Associate Matthew Gardner, the first author of the study with Lisa M Kattenhorn of Harvard Medical School.The team also leveraged preexisting technology in designing a delivery vehicle - an engineered adeno-associated virus, a small, relatively innocuous virus that causes no disease.

It also protects against much-higher doses of virus than occur in most human transmission and does so for at least eight months after injection.“Our compound is the broadest and most potent entry inhibitor described so far,” said Michael Farzan, from the Florida campus of The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI).

Now, under the Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP) it will soon use the latest equipment and testing tool called CBNAAT (cartridge based nucleic acid amplification test). This is meant for HIV positive patients, who are extremely prone to get TB as a secondary infection due to the drastic fall in their immunity.The centre has already procured the CBNAAT equipment (commonly called as gene Xpert) under the RNTCP. It will be installed in a specially created laboratory for it in the IGGMC premises on March 24. Dr Sadaf Khateeb medical officer of NMC’s TB centre, said that this test has emerged as a boon to HIV patients, who are usually also suffering from TB.""Under the RNTCP programme, and as per WHO guidelines, we have been told to put all co-infected or HIV positive and suspected TB patient to this test. This can diagnose the patient for TB in general as well as the multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB within two hours. Since the instrument generates an automated report, the test can be conducted even by a laboratory technician ,"" she said.Though the centre is meant for only patients living within NMC limits, all patients found to be HIV positive at the Anti-Retro-viral Therapy (ART) centre of IGGMC, the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) or other NMC hospitals can be referred for TB and MDR-TB diagnosis here. “General TB patients still have to be diagnosed using the culture test, which takes about 3-5 months. But HIV positive patients suspected to be suffering from TB cannot be made to wait so much. Hence, such patients from all over the city, region and neighbouring states who come to government hospitals here can be sent to the NMC centre,” said Dr Khateeb.He said that cases of non-pulmonary (or non-lung) TB patients are on the rise in general but their percentage is higher in HIV positive patients. They are commonly diagnosed with abdominal TB, cervical lymph nodes (on the neck) etc. The HIV positive patients who are suffering from TB generally test negative in conventional smear test. But with CBNAAT, it will now be possible to easily diagnose them for TB or MDR-TB as soon as their ART treatment is started once they are referred to the NMC centre.In 2014, the centre had registered over 200 TB patients. Of these, 95% were tested for MDR and some 25-30 patients were HIV positive too. Hence, CBNAAT is set to change the diagnosis and naturally the treatment scenario of HIV positive and TB patients for the better.* CBNAAT is a molecular diagnostic test to detect TB or MDR-TB in a person within two hours* CBNAAT is very sensitive and precise* Since 2007, when NMC-TB Centre was set up, it has found 239 MDR-TB cases* Of these, 54 are still under treatment at the centre* Of the 54 MDR-TB cases, 11 are HIV positive and under treatment","['city', 'accurate', 'soon', 'hiv', 'patients', 'test', 'treatment', 'positive', 'testing', 'mdrtb', 'nmc', 'fast', 'centre', 'tb', 'cbnaat']","Dr Sadaf Khateeb medical officer of NMC’s TB centre, said that this test has emerged as a boon to HIV patients, who are usually also suffering from TB.

Coming to terms with the fact she and her six-year-old daughter are HIV positive, the 30-year-old daily wage worker is also faced with another challenge. Her daughter is underweight and Lakshmi is unable to provide her with nutritious meals because she has to spend most of her earnings on medicines. ""I can only afford rice, not green leafy vegetables, milk and eggs that the doctor advised for my daughter. Where will I find the money for it,"" she says.Lakshmi is not the exception. A study conducted by the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis (NIRT) in the city found that more than half the children (59%) living with HIV hail from families that do not have reliable access to sufficient quantity of affordable and nutritious food, leading to malnutrition. This is mainly because HIV hits the productive age groups the most, causing a dip in the family income and reduced food availability for the entire household. The study shows that the effect of food insecurity in these families has left 72% of children above five and living with HIV underweight , about 69% with stunted growth and 76% wasting (low weight for height). The proportion was high especially when compared to data from the National Family Health Survey which shows the national average for underweight children and those with stunted growth below the age of five varies between 40 and 50% and between 48 and 60% respectively.The 147 children aged between one and 15 years surveyed for the study conducted at the anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centre of a government tertiary-care hospital were either under the care of a single parent, mostly the mother as the father had died of HIV, or under foster care. Food insecurity in households is a problem across the country and one might ask why only children with HIV. Infections like HIV are catabolic diseases which results in diminished muscle mass and body fat. So, the daily dietary need of those with HIV is more,"" says C Padmapriyadarsini, scientist, NIRT.Since malnutrition in early childhood has a spiralling effect leading to decreased cognitive, psychosocial and physical development which would affect the academic performance of the child, NIRT has recommended measures to complement the ART course. While Anti-Retroviral Therapy has been effective in controlling the disease, the study suggests interventions like targeted food assistance to the families.Padmapriyadarsini says that a nutritional supplement would also go a long way in increasing adherence to drug management and improving nutritional status. The drugs would then act better on the individual without adverse effects and it would enhance a child's development.The children involved in the NIRT study have been regularly provided with such nutritional supplements and their parents trained to provide such a diet at home at low cost. The study was done in association with Institute of Child Health and Hospital For Children and Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society. NIRT now hopes that it can convince policymakers to adopt a similar strategy on a broader level. According to the National AIDS Control Organisation, there are 6,504 children living with HIV/AIDS in Tamil Nadu. Of these, 2,201 are boys and 1,849 are girls aged below 15, who are on ART as of September 2014.","['kids', 'hiv', '60', 'tn', 'face', 'underweight', 'study', 'nearly', 'insecurity', 'national', 'daughter', 'nutritional', 'children', 'nirt', 'food', 'living']","Coming to terms with the fact she and her six-year-old daughter are HIV positive, the 30-year-old daily wage worker is also faced with another challenge.

Jerry Hughes from Minnesota, USA, has been coming to the city for the last 10 years to spread awareness about HIV-AIDS and inspire PLHIVs to be optimistic. Through the Hughes Foundation, he has also made considerable contributions to the lives of positive people in Namibia and India. Having shifted base to the city in December, after leaving a well paying job and a promising career in advertising, Jerry now plans to focus all his energies on helping HIV positive children and women of the region.“For ten years, I have been visiting Nagpur off and on to interact with PLHIVs and activists here. I felt like the place and the people were beckoning me to help and contribute in any way I could. It led to what I call ‘India 10.0’, a project in which we aim to change the face of AIDS in India. We have started with 17 orphans who are HIV positive,” said Jerry, himself an HIV positive person.For two months now, an old, beat up car is being used to cater to the health needs of these and other kids with the infection. The organization also runs a pen pal programme for women suffering from the disease, where they write emails to students at Jerry’s alma mater, the University of Minnesota . His ultimate goal is to start a centre that provides free treatment, counselling and creates awareness about the disease.The kids under the project have been provided for by a corporate group from the city while activist Samir Shinde has been looking after them for the past four years. “These are children who require special care in terms of health, nutrition, medication and developmental issues.

In 2013, 505 new cases were detected whereas in 2014 the number fell to 449.Vandana Pathankar, project director, GSACS, said that on April 1 they completed 10 years of introduction of ART therapy in Goa. While initially there was only one ART centre located in Goa Medical College (GMC) and Hospital, Bambolim, which catered to over 1,000 patients, where free anti-retroviral drugs were made available, subsequently link ART plus centers were opened in the South Goa district hospital, Margao, sub-district hospital, Ponda and Cottage hospital, Chicalim.A large number of HIV infections occurred through the perinatal route, and annual infections through this route were between 4 to 5%. The GSACS has adopted Prevention of Parent-to-child Transmission (PPTCT) strategy which is considered cost-effective method in controlling the virus via this route. This programme basically helps effective reduction of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection by providing quality antenatal care including preventive services.Since introduction of this programme, HIV prevalence rate among antenatal mothers who accepted HIV test has decreased from 1.48 %, in 2003 to 0.18 in 2013.GSACS’s annual bulletin has revealed that 89% of the spouses who opted for HIV test were tested positive, and HIV prevalence directly in labour has decreased from 2.46% in 2003 to 0% in 2013.Also, prominent change noted by GSACS is that the proportion of direct walk-in persons undergoing HIV testing has registered a steep increase — this is also true of female patients.Currently, GSACS also focuses on improving HIV/AIDs awareness, controlling sexually transmitted diseases (STD), including condom promotion, and ensuring availability of safe blood and blood products.Another focus area of GSACS is ART. The ART, though it does not cure HIV, it slows down the virus from multiplying so fewer viruses attack the immune system once an HIV positive person starts the treatment, says a doctor at GSACS.An HIV positive person on ART therapy can to a large extent lead a healthy life but subject to good adherence to the first line of ART.

However, there is one vaccine that has been found to cut TB disease incidence in India by half — food.Chronic lack of adequate food is the reason for more than half of the TB infections here progressing to become a fullblown disease, says a study.In an international publication 'Eradicating TB - Challenges, Perspectives, Solutions', of the Observer Research Foundation, experts from across the world and India stressed on the need for India's TB control programme to take into account the role of social conditions such as rising inequity, malnutrition , poverty and over-crowding in the spread of TB.Even though 40% of the Indian population or 480 million people carry the TB bug within their body, TB cases annually is estimated to be 2.3 million, a fraction of those who carry the infection. ""Over 90% of those carrying the TB bug are able to prevent the infection from becoming TB disease with the help of the body's immune system. Anything that reduces the strength of one's immunity, like lack of good nutritious food, increases the risk of contracting TB,"" explained Dr Anurag Bhargava of the Himalayan Institute of Medicine and an expert on TB treatment.Instead of Direct Observed Treatment Short course (DOTS), a World Health Organisation (WHO) concept, Dr Bhargava felt that it might be more effective to have a programme more suited to Indian needs called DOST—Directly Observed and Supported Treatment – which would offer TB patients and their families nutritional support and counselling through behavorial change of healthcare providers along with treatment.He added that several studies have shown that unlike many African countries, where HIV is the biggest risk factor for TB, in India, 55% of TB is attributable to under nutrition.An annual estimated mortality of 2, 70,000 deaths means that TB claims one life in India every two minutes. According to R S Gupta, former deputy director general of the Central TB Division in India, malnutrition is one of the primary reasons for the high incidence of TB. ""TB patients suffers from loss of appetite, nutrient malabsorption, micronutrient malabsorption and altered metabolism, which leads to wasting. Deficiency in proteins and micronutrients increases the risk of TB. It has been found that malnourished TB patients have delayed recovery and higher mortality rates than well-nourished patients,"" said Gupta.""It cannot be stressed enough that without ensuring better nutrition and environmental conditions, mere medication, no matter how good and effectively administered, is unlikely to solve the problem,"" said Harsh Sethi of the Observer Research Foundation. He added that, an underfed citizenry forced to live in unsanitary surroundings is unlikely to respond favourably to medical care.","['research', 'hiv', 'vaccine', 'patients', 'disease', 'world', 'malnutrition', 'risk', 'treatment', 'cases', '55', 'unlikely', 'india', 'tb']","""Over 90% of those carrying the TB bug are able to prevent the infection from becoming TB disease with the help of the body's immune system.

It showed not just significant improvement in nutritional parameters, but also that the CD4 cell count of these patients remained stable, indicating their immunity was being maintained. The patients who took part in the study were were not on antiretroviral therapy (ART).CD4 cells are a type of white blood cells that protect the body from infection. Once infected with HIV, the cells are attacked and destroyed by the virus. However, at the time of the study, the guideline recommended initiation of ART before CD4 cell counts decrease below 250 cells while the recent guidelines suggest 350 cells.Malnutrition in HIV-positive adults is an issue that requires special attention as it leads to faster disease progression, high mortality rate and suboptimal response to anti-retroviral therapy. And if they are the bread winners, it could affect the whole family.The nutritional parameters that were observed to have significantly increased among the group that received macronutrient supplement are body weight, body mass index, mid-arm circumference, fat-free mass, and body cell mass. The observation was compared with that of a control group of 79 patients who received only standard care. This group did not show any improvement, and their CD4 count dropped.While the standard care involved treatment to prevent other diseases and treating common infections, by providing multivitamin tablets, nutritional counselling and psychosocial support. The supplement group, meanwhile, also got a mixture of whole wheat and soya bean flour fortified with vitamins and folic acid, providing a high-calorie, high-protein diet.NIRT director Dr Soumya Swaminathan said that though an increase in nutrition levels were observed, they may not be statistically significant. That was partly due to the study design and other biological and behaviourial factors.Scientist C Padmapriyadarsini says that the patients in the ‘beneficiary' group were also given interesting recipes to try out new ways to cook and eat.

And what does a poor, sick mother, desperately trying to ensure that her HIV positive orphaned child gets his essential daily dose of life-saving medicines get? Insensitivity, buck-passing and indolence by the government medical fraternity and the BSACS officials!On Thursday, incidentally observed as AIDS Orphans Day (part of the annual global Aids awareness week), a desperate 25-year-old widow in Chhapra was running from pillar to post in a frantic bid to obtain the next dose of ART for her eight-year-old son. An HIV positive person needs to take the prescribed medicine daily, just like a daily insulin dose for diabetics. If the dose is missed, even for a day, the immune system of the patient starts deteriorating. The people at the ART dispensing centre were helpless, stocks were over (The special ART formulation for children is given in a syrup form). When the woman, in desperation, went to submit a written intimation to the nodal medical officer, pleading that the medicine be made available, she was brushed aside. He refused to accept her application.The woman, a widow, who somehow ekes out a living working in a private school, is distraught. For the past five days, she has abandoned her work, running to and fro the dispensing centre. The irony is that the medication can only be obtained from the government centre and no private chemist shop in Chhapra stocks the medicine, which is very expensive.“I went to get the medicines on the May 4, a day before the last dose ran out (This is the practice. Patients are given medicines for a month only, and they can’t ask for any advance stock). There was no medicine available. My child is on ART since 2011. What’s worrying me is that in January, when a CD-4 count was done, his platelet count had dropped to 311 from 1100. I’m desperate,” she said over the phone.Exactly 14 days ago, I happened to visit the Chhapra ART centre with RTI activist Sanjeet Singh, where the persons concerned told us that stocks were low. “We are just not receiving adequate stocks from BSACS, and we struggle to do what we can,” they said.“The high court has decreed that every ART centre should have a two-month stock of ART medicines and medicines for opportunistic infections, but despite assurances from BSACS officials, see the situation!” says Sanjeet.In Chhapra, the situation is overwhelming. Last month 1748 patients received ART. There are about 150 children on ART. NACO guidelines are not met. BSACS has not appointed the required staff. No medical officer, so obviously, no ‘accountable’ official! Pregnant women have to buy their own ‘safe delivery kits’ from private stores in Patna because the hospital has no stock. HIV positive pregnant women are denied surgery at Chhapra. The official line is, “So far, no such case has been brought to our notice.” There is no CD4 testing machine, even though NACO funds were there for one unit in each district, it is said. The woman says, “My child is the only reason I am living, if he dies, I am nothing, I might as well destroy myself.” Just as I write the finishing line to this article, Saturday 8am, I receive a phone call. The ART medicines have finally arrived, and will be given out today.

The virus was unable to replicate in human cells in vitro.The discovery may have applications in treating cancer, which also has an immense appetite for sugar and other nutrients in the cell, which it needs to grow and spread.""This compound can be the precursor for something that can be used in the future as part of a cocktail to treat HIV that improves on the effective medicines we have today,"" said Harry Taylor, assistant professor in Medicine-Infectious Diseases.HIV needs to grow in a type of immune cell (CD4+ T-cell) that is active, meaning it is already responding to pathogens in the blood.Activation increases the T-cell's supplies of sugar and other critical nutrients needed for both cell and virus growth.Until now, no one knew the first step that signalled a newly activated T-cell to stock up on sugar and other nutrients. Those nutrients become the building blocks of genetic material the cell and the virus need to grow.Northwestern and Vanderbilt scientists figured out that the first step in stocking the T-cell's pantry involved turning on a cell component called phospholipase D1 (PLD1). Then they used an experimental compound to block PLD1 and shut down the pipeline.This is believed to be the first time scientists have targeted the virus's ability to pilfer the cell's pantry to stop its growth.The compound also slowed the proliferation of the abnormally activated immune cells, the study found.Current HIV medications stop HIV growth but do not affect the abnormal excess activation and growth of immune cells triggered by HIV.The excess immune cell growth is believed to contribute to the life-long persistence of HIV and leads to excess inflammation that causes premature organ damage in HIV patients - even when the virus is suppressed by current medicines.""Perhaps this new approach, which slows the growth of the immune cells, could reduce the dangerous inflammation and thwart the life-long persistence of HIV,"" Taylor added.

The researchers showed that immunisation with eOD-GT8 60mer produced antibody “precursors” — with some of the traits necessary to recognize and block HIV infection.

The National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) has sounded an alert on the unexpected spurt in fresh HIV infections in Punjab and Chandigarh. Experts are calling this 'worrisome' because both regions were seen as low prevalence places compared to other parts of the country.NACO officials believe the jump may be because of an increase in the number of injecting drug users (IDUs), however, there is no data available on such drug users.These numbers have come to light when the Union home minister Rajnath Singh, on his visit to Anandpur Sahib last week, had asked the youth in Punjab to shun drugs. His statement upset the ruling Akali Dal which has said that Punjab is being defamed for fighting the drug menace.NACO's observations have been seconded by another report of the parliamentary standing committee on health and family welfare submitted to the Rajya Sabha in April. It names Assam, Delhi, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Punjab and Uttarakhand as states which have shown a rise in adult HIV prevalence. It also points at reduced funding to NACO which may have shrunk its role in these regions.Dr B B Rewari, national programme officer (antiretroviral therapy), NACO, said, ""The rise is in the last five years. Punjab has more IDUs than the north-eastern states and that is main risk factor for HIV infections.""In fact, Chandigarh, which is often seen as insulated from Punjab's drug problem because of its Union Territory status, has started showing some of the symptoms. A study, 'High risk behaviours of injecting drug users (IDUs) in Chandigarh' says that 48.9% of IDUs shared needles. The study was conducted by A Das Mohapatra, Manmeet Kaur, Rajesh Kumar and P V M Lakshmi of Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research.The prevalence of needle sharing has been reported by various national studies to be 30.3% and 41.9% among IDUs in Haryana and Punjab. ""Chandigarh is not far from Punjab which has a high number of IDUs. So, we are not surprised by the results,"" says Kumar.","['union', 'idus', 'hiv', 'punjab', 'drug', 'prevalence', 'chandigarh', 'fresh', 'naco', 'national', 'cases', 'jump', 'users']","The National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) has sounded an alert on the unexpected spurt in fresh HIV infections in Punjab and Chandigarh.

Over 182 projects that cater to nearly three lakh high-risk population in the state will suffer as distribution of condoms and syringes to availability of medicines and testing kits will take a direct hit.The circular issued on June 11 has asked NGOs and community-based organizations (CBOs) to curtail the strength of their peer educators by 80% and outreach workers by 25%. A majority of these agencies have not received a dime from the state body since January this year, and therefore have been grappling with massive attrition due to non-payment of salaries.The sacking of peer educators and outreach workers will directly impact the distribution of condoms, lubricants and syringes in the state’s most vulnerable pockets. Peer educators are members or leaders who belong to the high-risk community (female sex workers, transgenders and men having sex with men) and carry out the crucial task of distributing condoms and motivating people to get tested.The MSACS in its circular blamed the change in funding pattern of the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) for the delay in receiving funds, which are likely to arrive only by October this year. However, TOI has learned that NACO had released around Rs 8 crore as a contingency measure, which has been lying with the state treasury for the past two months. Project director Khushalsinh Pardeshi could not be reached for comment.MSACS that presented an annual budget of Rs 130.12 crore had received only three-fourths of the money. The annual plan for 2015-2016 of nearly Rs 200 crore is yet to be approved by NACO, which has committed only 80% or less.Maharashtra till date remains one of the six high-risk states in the country with a prevalence rate of 0.40%. According to NACO’s annual report, over 40,000 people had tested positive for HIV in 2013-2014 out of the 20 lakh who were tested, indicating that the HIV scare is still very pertinent.The fund crunch, said to be one of the worst for the state body, has already started affecting people living with HIV. The stock of anti-retroviral medicines that keep nearly 1.80lakh adults and 11,000 children alive is erratic. While NACO provides the ART drugs, MSACS would often financially support NGOS to locally purchase drugs if the drugs did not come on time. “CBOs like us are struggling for existence. Who do you think will worry about some patients not getting medicines on time or progressing to the second line?” asked a Pune-based agency that is thinking of giving up three of its projects.The crisis has also reached the state body’s doorstep. Sources told TOI that the last lot of condoms has already been distributed to NGOs, while consumables required to draw blood and carry out HIV tests are long over at MSACS. Worse, the state body has run out of paper to print HIV test reports at several of its Integrated Centres for Counselling and Testing (ICTC).“It is appalling how a national programme used the services of female sex workers and transgenders and now wants to get rid of them. Many of them have left prostitution to work fully for the programme. What are we going to tell them?” questioned Meena Seeshu, who runs three projects at Sangli. As per the state diktat, 40 of her peer educators stand to lose employment. “We suspect the rate of new infections is already going up,” said a Pune-based NGO’s director. Following the circular, at least two NGOs have communicated to MSACS that they will be withdrawing their projects with female sex workers and migrants.When TOI contacted NACO, a senior official from the finance department said that it is time the state bore some burden of the HIV programme. “We have formed a committee that will negotiate with state governments. We will still be paying most of the money,” the official said. The country’s HIV programme has taken a beating since multilateral organizations, including WHO and several UN agencies such as UNICEF and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), have drastically reduced or diverted funds since 2013.","['peer', 'hiv', 'msacs', 'programme', 'workers', 'sex', 'ngos', 'maharashtra', 'funds', 'naco', 'educators', 'condoms', 'state', '3l', 'risk']","MUMBAI: A practically broke Maharashtra State Aids Control Society ( MSACS ) has asked NGOs to curtail their HIV prevention activities in the state and do away with a significant chunk of their workforce.

Because of the handwritten pamphlet, all her relatives and friends who visited her at the hospital have now come to know of her HIV positive status, adding to the woman's extreme anxiety.When news about the ill-treatment of Meena reached the Care Support Centre (CSC) that fights for the rights of people living with HIV (PLHIVs), members of its district responsible team (DRT), Ritu Saxena and Vinita Devi, went to the hospital where they found the piece of paper still stuck to her bedside.“We immediately tore it off and took the authorities to task. Fearing that the issue might become too big to handle, the hospital staff rushed to control the damage,” Saxena told TOI on Thursday.Hospital authorities confirmed the “unfortunate” incident and said they have apologized to the patient. “I understand this should not have happened but the doctors have given a written apology and the patient has made peace with the staff,” said Abhilasha Gupta, head of the obstetrics and gynaecology department at the hospital.Talking to TOI from her bed, Meena said that she had contracted the disease from her husband eight years ago and had kept it a closely guarded secret. “Due to the negligence of the doctors, it has now become public knowledge,” she said. “Not only did I have to face abuse about my condition, even my girl child was not spared. They termed her a ‘dreaded disease’,” she wept.CSC coordinator Badri Singh has now filed a written complaint with the nodal officer at Anti Retro Viral Therapy Centre, LLRM. “The pasting of the paper sheet at the bedside was wrong.

After exposing the cells to IL-21, they introduced HIV-1 and found that after 72 hours, cultures with IL-21 contained more than two-thirds less virus than those that didn't receive the treatment.The second model tested IL-21 in mice transplanted with human stem cells to create a physiological environment as close as possible to that in people.Over the course of two weeks, the mice began producing IL-21. After 14 days, more than half of the mice with IL-21 did not display a detectable level of HIV-1.An analysis of the results suggested that IL-21 not only jump starts the immune system but also stops the HIV-1 virus from replicating during a critical, early window of its development, when it is concentrated in one location and has not yet started to spread throughout the body.""This study highlights components of the human immune system that are capable of mounting an antiviral response and driving intrinsic resistance to HIV-1,"" said senior author Dr Laurie H Glimcher, of Weill Cornell Medical College.""We are hopeful that this knowledge will help bring us one step closer to shielding patients from this deadly and complex virus,"" Glimcher said.The reduction in viral load is due to the cascade of events initiated by IL-21.The investigators found that IL-21 instructs CD4 T cells to increase the amount of a small RNA molecule. That molecule, microRNA-29 (miR-29), inhibits the replication of HIV-1, limiting the amount of virus produced from infected cells.""Our study has uncovered a potentially potent arsenal that patients have against the virus. We think IL-21 is one of those arsenals and that deploying it early will be very powerful in fighting the infection,"" said lead author Dr Stanley Adoro, a postdoctoral associate in medicine in Glimcher's lab.The study was published in the journal Nature Communications.","['hiv1', 'hiv', 'cells', 'virus', 'scientists', 'study', 'human', 'mice', 'system', 'immune', 'infection', 'potential', 'il21', 'therapy']","""This study highlights components of the human immune system that are capable of mounting an antiviral response and driving intrinsic resistance to HIV-1,"" said senior author Dr Laurie H Glimcher, of Weill Cornell Medical College.

Trouble started brewing at NACO since 2013, when several international agencies started diverting funds from HIV to other diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria and dengue. The NACO, now completely dependent on the central government funds, has been facing financial constraint itself. The crisis became more pronounced with the Centre slashing health budget by 17% last year.Sawant explained that NACO may be looking at 75:25 funding model, which currently exists for other national programmes such as the National Rural Health Mission. “NACO is expecting us to bear 25% of the programme cost. We have told the Centre that the state is already grappling with fund crunch. So, they should grant funds till we can allocate something from the state kitty,” Sawant added. MSACS has a budget of nearly Rs 150 crore that is used to sustain 142 of the 182 targeted intervention projects in the state. “The state programme caters to over eight lakh people, including female sex workers,” said an NGO from Pune that has not received any funds since January.According to the MSACS circular, NGOs have to do away with 80% of the sanctioned strength of peer educators and 25% of outreach workers. On onwe hand, project director of MSACS Khushalsinh Pardeshi has assured that the core prevention activities will not suffer, but on the other hand, he admitted that NACO is behind its schedule of approving the 2015-16 plan for HIV prevention. “NACO has asked state governments to contribute at least 50% of the cost,” he said.Stuck in this confusion are community-based organizations, such as Malwani-based Sakhi Char Chowghi Trust that works towards prevention of HIV among transgender and fear closure now as they are completely dependent on MSACS’s funds. MSACS, meanwhile, is desperately hoping that the state will expedite and release an amount of Rs 11.89 crore sanctioned by NACO, but waiting for cabinet approval. Till then, over 3000 people, many of who are HIV positive, fear loss of livelihood from July.","['cost', 'funding', 'hiv', 'msacs', 'hivcontrol', 'programme', 'health', 'prevention', 'naco', 'funds', 'national', 'state', 'share', 'noncommittal']","Trouble started brewing at NACO since 2013, when several international agencies started diverting funds from HIV to other diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria and dengue.

The hospital and the two doctors have, however, denied any wrongdoing and said they would appeal against the verdict.The lawyer, Subhash Mohanrao Pachlore, of Harsul in Aurangabad, was admitted to the hospital by his wife and relatives on July 11, 2007. He had a history of headaches, giddiness and loss of consciousness. A physician at the hospital, M A Majid, sent Pachlore’s blood sample to a pathology laboratory for the HIV test.Pachlore told the forum that when he was being discharged from hospital three days later, the physician told his wife in the presence of relatives about the laboratory report indicating the HIV-positive status. He said the hospital discharge card also mentioned the HIV positivity.Pachlore took the HIV test again at another pathology laboratory on July 14 but the findings were negative. In 2009, he filed a complaint with district forum against the hospital and the medical practitioners at the hospital and the first laboratory.The forum headed by K N Tungar and comprising of members Sandhya Barlinge and Kiran R Thole observed, “The respondents were negligent in rendering their service to the complainant.

They are guilty of causing mental and psychological agony to the wife of the complainant.The complainant and his wife must have experienced huge affliction during such a long period and lost their peace of mind.”Physician Majid told TOI that Pachlore had been hospitalised for cortical venous sinus thrombosis. He claimed that after the first HIV test was reactive, it was repeated the same day. “The second finding was negative. Pachlore’s wife was counselled and informed as he was drowsy and irritable. He was discharged after three days,” he said.Majid said Pachlore had faith in the hospital as he got re-admitted for fever three days later. “He has suppressed this fact. Due to poor legal representation, the district forum imposed a fine on us in 2010. We appealed in the state forum and the fine was reduced to Rs 5 lakh. We challenged it in the national forum, which quashed both the orders and sent the matter back to the district forum saying that no proper opportunity was given to the respondents and that no medical expert evidence was taken by the lower courts,” he said.Majid said they had got their deposit with interest on the order of the national forum. “The complainant went to Supreme Court for a stay on the judgment of the national forum, which was dismissed in 2011.

This is in contrast to previous years when the hospital used to get three to four cases of babies born infected with the deadly disease, yearly. This, doctors say, proves the results of prevention of parent to child transmission are finally showing.Prevention of parent to child transmission was introduced in Goa after a significant number of new HIV cases were found to be occurring through the perinatal route— transmission of an illness from mother to child. A change was seen after new guidelines were rolled out by the National Aids Control Organization (NACO) in January 2014.Dr Wanda Viegas, senior medical officer at the antiretroviral therapy (ART) centre at GMC, said that a significant change was seen after they started implementing the new guidelines. Now, a pregnant woman who’s HIV positive is immediately put on ART as opposed to the earlier method of starting treatment in the delivery room after pregnancy. Then, the mother was given a single dose of Nevirapine tablet and the baby a single dose of syrup.ART is a combination of drugs given to HIV-infected persons with CD4 count less than 350. The CD4 count is an indicator of one’s immune system, and a falling CD4 count means a person infected with HIV is exposed to opportunistic infections. Normally, ART treatment for HIV patients is started only after his/her clinical investigation is conducted but Viegas said that in the case of pregnant mothers, they do not wait until the investigation is completed.“The HIV carrier who’s pregnant is immediately put on ART while an investigation is conducted subsequently,” she added. Since April, three pregnant women have been put on the medication.Currently, 280 children are registered with the ART centre, of which 184 children are undergoing ART. “Some of the children going through ART have now attained 18-20 years of age and are doing well,” she said.Doctors say that it is sad as some HIV positive children who have lost one or both parents, are entirely dependant on other members of the family who in most cases, do not care enough. A doctor says, “We have a case of a boy who lost both his parents to AIDS. His visits to the ART center are irregular as his uncle does not give him money to travel.”Some children, mostly above 10 years of age, come to the centre alone to collect their monthly dose of medicines in the absence of a family member to escort them. An HIV positive person taking ART can lead a healthy life provided he/she sticks to a healthy lifestyle and adheres completely to the therapy.","['help', 'drop', 'babies', 'hiv', 'transmission', 'naco', 'positive', 'pregnant', 'art', 'birth', 'count', 'child', 'children', 'state', 'investigation', 'dose', 'guidelines']","PANAJI: Since 2014, 22 babies born to HIV positive mothers at Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, have tested negative.

I was asked to make my life count,” said Noori, a transgender who gave up commercial sex work to help people from her community.The woman who delivered the report to Noori was Dr Suniti Solomon , whose pioneering work in HIV a year earlier had startled the medical fraternity and pushed the government to act. In 1986, Dr Solomon, then a microbiologist at Madras Medical College, and her team for the first time documented evidence of HIV infection in India. Noori was among the second batch of around 135 commercial sex workers from Chennai who were tested. “She didn’t just break down science for us.

Born into the illustrious Gaitonde family, Dr Solomon graduated from Madras Medical College. She married eminent cardio-thoracic surgeon Dr Solomon Victor. While Dr Solomon Victor focused on treating poor patients and in 1989 conceived the Rheumatic Heart Ailment project, Dr Suniti Solomon moved beyond research to set up Y R Gaitonde Centre for AIDS Research and Education (YRG CARE), a premier HIV/AIDS care and support centre, in Chennai.“More than the virus itself, Dr Solomon was concerned about the stigma HIV positive people faced,” said Dr D Dhanikachalam, head of technical support unit, Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TANSACS). “When the epidemic was first discovered, people were afraid to go close to those with HIV. She felt the pain they went through and worked to fight not just the virus but the discrimination too,” he said.Trained in pathology in the UK and the US, her experience covered a range of aspects linked to HIV infection, biomedical parameters to socio-economics. She also published papers extensively on HIV epidemiology, prevention, care, support and related gender issues. In 2012, Dr Suniti Solomon was given the Lifetime Achievement Award for Service on HIV/AIDS by the state-run Dr MGR Medical University here.In 2009, the ministry of science and technology conferred the ‘National Women Bio-scientist Award’ on her. In 2001, she was given a similar award for her pioneering work on HIV/AIDS by the state run-medical varsity. A fellow of National Academy of Medical Sciences (NAMS), New Delhi, she had served on several boards, including National Technical Team on Women and AIDS, Advisory Board of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative-India, the Scientific Committee of the National AIDS Research Institute Pune and the Microbicide Committee of Indian Council of Medical Research.“She was a no nonsense person with a high sense of commitment. Her work is testified through hundreds of publications and her contribution is acknowledged across the world. As a teacher, she taught over 25 batches of students in MMC,” Dr Sundararaman.In an earlier interaction with TOI, Dr Solomon had commended the work Tamil Nadu had done in the field of HIV/AIDS and said the state had come a long way in screening, but the programmes had become complacent with counselling. “We have contained the infection to an extent among truckers and female sex workers. But if we become complacent there will be an increase of incidence among these as well,” she had said.People who worked with her are not surprised by her prediction. “She worked tirelessly for the cause not just inside labs but outside as well. If she was concerned, there were obvious reasons,” said a microbiologist, who worked closely with her in the late 90’s. Dr Solomon also said it was unfortunate that despite 30 years of the HIV epidemic and the progress made, there is still no cure or effective vaccine for the infection. “But what is killing people with AIDS more is the stigma and discrimination,” she had said.","['aids', 'worked', 'science', 'noori', 'hiv', 'threat', 'dies', 'dr', 'woke', 'medical', 'national', 'work', 'solomon', 'india', '76', 'suniti']","In 1986, Dr Solomon, then a microbiologist at Madras Medical College, and her team for the first time documented evidence of HIV infection in India.
She taught us to live,” said Noori.For close to three decades Dr Solomon used science to save and make lives, and lost hers to cancer.
Born into the illustrious Gaitonde family, Dr Solomon graduated from Madras Medical College.
She married eminent cardio-thoracic surgeon Dr Solomon Victor.
Dr Solomon also said it was unfortunate that despite 30 years of the HIV epidemic and the progress made, there is still no cure or effective vaccine for the infection."

It is expected to reach over 11crore people across rural and urban India.Naik said that the government has an aggressive intervention programme to combat HIV/AIDS. The unique feature of the anti-HIV programme is that it has always kept the marginalized and high-risk groups as the focus areas. Over 15,000 integrated counselling and testing centres are now functional across the country. Over 410 anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centres provide treatment to about 7.4 lakh HIV patients in India.Naik said that since Goa is a popular tourist destination, it needs a robust strategy. This is an important occasion to reiterate that our prevention service reaches every person.Parsekar said that of the 120 crore people in India, 50% are below the age of 25 and that is why, it is imperative to focus on issues affecting the youth and to understand the challenges they face. Though HIV has declined in Goa in recent years, the government wants to take it to zero level and also do away with the stigma attached to it.Another highlight of the function is the testimonies given by two teenagers from Bengaluru. Babu Seenappa, 14, and Manik Prabhu, 16, both represented India in the international children’s games in Netherlands in June this year. Both are HIV positive and reside at Sneha Care Home, Bengaluru. Seenappa was born with HIV but now competes in 5km and 10km races. Prabhu runs 100m and relays.Speaking about his participation in an international competition, Babu said it was a proud moment for him. “HIV did not stop me and will never stop me from doing anything. Many of my friends have been denied admissions to schools because of their HIV status but we cannot spread infection through normal contact. Let us build a better world free from stigma and discrimination,” he said.","['help', 'stop', 'hiv', 'spread', 'youth', 'treatment', 'provide', 'testing', 'international', 'awareness', 'goa', 'app', 'minister']","The unique feature of the anti-HIV programme is that it has always kept the marginalized and high-risk groups as the focus areas.

The 42-year-old has been an HIV positive since 2004 and initially he was in a bad condition. Doctors too had given up on him. But today, Keshava is leading a dignified life. He could walk over 3km a day without any support.""I did not think I could live. It's only because of self-confidence and moral support that I could survive,"" says Keshava. Initially, he did not take treatment due to financial constraints. He owned a petty shop to sustain his family. In 2011, his health deteriorated and he was bedridden, unable to even move his hands. Doctors sent him back home losing all hope, he added.His mother Sathyavathi says she owes it all to the Swami Vivekananda Youth Movement (SVYM). ""If my son is alive, it's only because of SVYM and its volunteers' moral support,"" she says.Despite his failing health, he did small jobs like starting a mobile recharge shop to support his family.Thanks to the palliative care facility of SVYM, the bedridden patients and their families get support. The facility, apart from taking care of patients, also helps their family members to avail governmental benefits. ""Now, I am receiving widow pension and my son is getting pension from the government. Palliative care volunteers helped me get these benefits,"" said Sathyavathi.The CD4 count in HIV patients should be above 350 but if the count falls below that, patients may become bedridden and the risks are very high, says district AIDS controller Dr T Raghu Kumar. Keshava had CD4 count below 50 when palliative care volunteers visited him in 2012.Like him, more than 300 bedridden needy patients have availed palliative care. Today, some of them are leading a dignified life. ""The goal is to improve the quality of life for patients and their families. The need of palliative care is essential in terminal and chronic diseases as they are incurable and result in physical, psychological, socio-economic strain to individuals and their families,"" says palliative care volunteer Dr Deepak Murthy.The palliative care facility has served 345 bedridden patients suffering from cancer, paralysis, spinal cord injury, severe neurological disorders, hypertension, gangrene, kidney failure, cerebral palsy and other illnesses since 2011. Initially, 88 patients were inducted into the programme. Palliative care operates with a team approach consisting of doctors, nurses, counsellors, social workers and volunteers visiting each patient's home and providing a holistic care for patients to improve the quality of life by using an array of skills at their doorstep.","['dignified', 'volunteers', 'help', 'life', 'bedridden', 'hiv', 'keshava', 'svym', 'patients', 'lead', 'moral', 'care', 'lives', 'palliative', 'support']","MYSURU: Self-confidence and moral support can beat all odds in life.

Shreshtha (name changed), a woman from Kangra district, was thrown out of her house by her in-laws on coming to know about her HIV status. This despite the fact that she was infected by her husband, a truck driver and was forced to live in misery along with her two children. However, she was lucky to get help of village panchayats and a local NGO. Today, she is heading an organization that works in association with panchayati raj institutions to create awareness about HIV positive people. In 2011, she was also awarded the best social worker award.Bhago (name changed), another HIV positive woman from Kangra district, was passed on the infection by her husband. However, the damage catapult as by the time she came to know about her being HIV positive, she had three children from the marriage.

He said drug abuse is increasing in border areas of the state and that is leading increasing cases of HIV too.He said that recently a meeting was held in which a proposal to provide pension to HIV positive people and bus passes for free travel for treatment was discussed too.A health official said that female sex workers are being provided vocation training and 550 have already been included under livelihood training. Vocation training to them would be provided at Industrial Training Institutes of Nahan, kala Amb, Solan, Bilaspur, Mandi, Shimla, Nalagrh and Baddi.Though Himachal Pradesh falls under the category of low prevalent state where the infection rate among the adult HIV prevalence is 0.17% with total count of positive persons at 8,091, efforts are on to nail down the causes that are resulting in spread of HIV/AIDS.

The app would provide all kinds of information on AIDS, which is not easily available otherwise. For instance, it will provide information of HIV testing centres in the locality, information on availability of free testing kits and medicines etc.The app, called HELP ( HIV Education and Linkage to Prevention ), will also prompt users to access HIV testing from the nearest centre free of cost.The idea is to bridge the awareness and accessibility gap through digital intervention and encourage youth to know their HIV status.

They refused to attend the monthly review meeting last Saturday. Staffers of ART centres and ICTC centres have also not got their salaries for last month and are joining this campaign.

These NGOs have not been getting any funds to run their projects since January this year. The money, coming from the union government, is supposed to be directed through the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS). Project managers from these organizations had been promised that at least part of the funds will be disbursed by September. While this has not happened, even salaries of the staff working under the MSACS have not been paid for September.

“The meeting on Saturday was a regular review meet in which NGOs are expected to share data and experiences about their monthly activities. This data form the basis for the plans to be made by the government with regards to the awareness activities and the ways to arrest the spread of HIV,” informed programme officer of District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) Tanuja Fale. She admitted that all eight NGOs from the district kept away from the meeting.

Similar meetings took place in all the districts of the state last week. Only 10-15 of the 156 NGOs attended them, most choosing to boycott it. As the salaries of staffers of Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) centres, Integrated Counseling and Testing Centres (ICTC) and DAPCU did not come for the month of September, they have stopped sending monthly reports they send to MSACS. These reports consist of information about the number of medicines taken by the HIV positive people in the district, stock of the medicines available at the centre and people walking in for getting tested for STIS, among other data.

“We have tried several democratic ways of getting the attention of the authorities to our problems. We have only been hearing that the money will come ‘in the next few days’ for the last eight months. We have also written letters to union minister Nitin Gadkari, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule and state health department, none of whom have given anything other than assurances,” said Hemlata Lohave, project manager of the targeted intervention programme at Red Cross Society.

She added that the government would be responsible if the HIV infection rose because of their inattention. This is bound to happen as not only are the awareness programmes for vulnerable population under threat but the People Living with HIV (PLHIV) are also not being catered to properly, said other activists.","['review', 'getting', 'hiv', 'boycott', 'msacs', 'district', 'fundstarved', 'ngos', 'meeting', 'nagpur', 'centres', 'monthly', 'state', 'salaries', 'minister']","NAGPUR: Having got no funding from government for more than nine months now, NGOs working towards spreading HIV-AIDS awareness are launching a non-cooperation movement.

They have not received any funds from the government for their projects since January this year.

They have already spoken with and written letters to officials from health department, Maharashtra State AIDS Control Organisation (MSACS) and several important leaders of the city. They are worried the government’s inattention towards these projects would lead to spurt in HIV infection, which has been stabilized after much effort.

“Nagpur district is among the places where the rate of infection has fallen very low. In Maharashtra, the rates have fallen from 9% to 0.6% between 2001 and 2015,” informed Pravin Hiware from Noble Shikshan Sanstha of Chandrapur that works among female sex workers (FSW), migrant workers and truckers. He added that FSWs who were free of the infection 15 years ago are still free of it because the organization’s efforts to make them more aware and distribute condoms among them.

Amit Nagrare from Gaurav Trust of the city said that inconsistent supply of medicines and condoms also affected the rapport that the project managers and counsellors share with the target population. “After this, when the counsellors want to take the people for getting tested for sexually transmitted infections, they refuse. All this makes them more vulnerable,” he said.

“Those who already have HIV also don’t get medicines in time. This can be fatal as their viral load can rise even if one dose of medicines is given late,” said project manager of Red Cross Society Hemlata Lohave.

Anand Chandrani from Sarathi Trust said that either the government must assure us that the funds would be released in time or clearly tell us that the projects do not need to be run anymore.

235,7-11-2015,['Nitasha Natu'],https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg,"GUAYAQUIL: Jean's book of heroes occupies pride of place at a clinic run by Fundacion VIHDA, a non-profit working to prevent transmission of HIV from mother to child in Ecuador's largest city, Guayaquil. One would expect illustrations of princes to jump out of the pages of her book. Instead, there are handmade drawings of her grandmother.Since her mother's death, Jean, who has tested HIV positive, is being looked after by her grandmother. The biggest concern for families like hers is how to break the news to a child about his/her HIV status. This concern prompted Fundacion VIHDA to come up with a programme for diagnostic disclosure of HIV to children and to prepare them for their life ahead. Two years since, 15 children, having an average age of 10 to 12 years, have completed the programme.Globally, 3.2 million children, under the age of 15, were living with HIV in 2013, according to UNAIDS. They comprised 9.1% of all people living with HIV. 240,000 children worldwide acquired HIV in 2013: one new infection every two minutes.""A significant number of kids in Ecuador acquire the HIV virus from their mothers who may not have been able to receive treatment on time to prevent transmission to the child. As kids grow up, they start asking questions. They know how to read signs at hospitals and labels on flasks. It is important for the child to know that he is not sick and that he has rights,"" says clinical psychologist Dr. Claudia Zambrano, one of the founding members of Fundacion VIHDA.Zambrano and her team have individual sessions, every fortnight, for children living with HIV that approach the clinic. A specific action plan is drawn up based on the personal situation of every child. ""We work with the child's personal history, their specific life circumstances and his/her family, in order to address their needs. The children are taught about wholesome health, just like in school. They are given a general idea about medical conditions, concepts like viral load (amount of HIV in a blood sample), drugs and how they react in the body,"" says Zambrano.Group sessions are held with peers after a couple of months so the child gets a support network.Nine-year-old Valentina had stumped a bunch of paramedics at her school when she told them that she had HIV. She had learnt of her diagnosis from her aunt and did not confide in her friends. But when the paramedics started quizzing students about their allergies and medical conditions, Valentina thought it was okay to tell. ""Valentina was nervous when the paramedics spoke to her teachers. I went over to her school and met the authorities. We spoke to Valentina and strengthened the feeling that there was nothing wrong with her,"" said Zambrano. After that episode at school, things changed as Valentina's teachers and principal were more open to the topic. Valentina continued two years more in the same school and is now in college. She comes regularly to the Fundacion VIHDA clinic and discusses updates in her life as a teenager, occasionally attending some of the group sessions held for younger kids living with HIV.The diagnostic disclosure programme has no fixed duration. ""Kids come to us at different stages. Some of them approach us in crisis after getting to know of their diagnosis in difficult situations. In such cases, we have to work on repair and stress on the fact that although the HIV status is an integral aspect of the child's life, it does not define him as a person. We seek family support and also counsel families on tackling the situation,"" says a member of the psychological counselling team at Fundacion VIHDA. Children in crisis are burdened with a lot of questions and anxieties. They know they have greater physical restrictions than other kids their age. Some of them fear they would die like their mother did. Others are worried that they would get sick often and may not have money to pay for medication in future. ""Children are taught to keep information about their health situation private and not disclose it to any of their friends or acquaintances. But there have been situations where classmates or teachers have found out and started discriminating against them. In such cases, parents or grandparents are encouraged to deal with the situation firmly as we have laws against discrimination of people living with HIV. The child may change schools to overcome discrimination. They work very hard to regain self-esteem and overcome that episode,"" says Zambrano.At Enrique Sotomayor, the largest maternity hospital in Guayaquil where 20% of Ecuador's children are born, a team headed by Dr. Mercedes Ortiz have been fighting to bring down the number of mother-to-child transmissions, despite scarce resources and cultural stigma against HIV. ""The risk of transmission from mother-to-child can occur during pregnancy, breastfeeding or birth. We provide information to all our female patients on why it's important to get tested for HIV and how to prevent transmission of the virus to their babies,"" says Ortiz.From the moment of diagnosis, antiretroviral (ARV) medication has to be administered to the pregnant woman and it has to continue indefinitely. Prior to the birth of the child, these ARVs reduce the amount of virus in the bloodstream and prevent transmission from mother-to-child. On birth, babies must be given infant antiretrovirals during the first month of their life and they have to remain under medical observation till they are 18.(This article was supported by the International Reporting Project.

The US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has approved Genvoya — a fixed-dose combination tablet containing elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide — as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and paediatric patients aged 12 and above.Though the drug is currently not available in India, experts say approval in the US is a major breakthrough and may trigger trials for the medicine in India, which has the third highest number of HIV-infected people in the world. Currently, India has over 20 lakh people living with HIV, while there are around 1.5 lakh children infected with the virus. Though India demonstrated an overall reduction of 57% in the annual new HIV infections among adults, it still witnesses around 1.2 lakh new infections and 1.5 lakh AIDS-related deaths every year.“Today’s approval of a fixed dose combination containing a new form of tenofovir provides another effective, once-daily, complete regimen for patients with HIV-1 infection,” said Edward Cox, director of the Office of Antimicrobial Products at USFDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.According to USFDA, Genvoya contains a new form of tenofovir that has not been previously approved. This new form provides lower levels of drug in the bloodstream, but higher levels within the cells, where HIV-1 replicates. “It was developed to help reduce some drug side effects ,” the regulator said.According to USFDA, the new drug also appears to be associated with less kidney toxicity and decreases in bone density than previously approved tenofovir-containing regimens based on laboratory measures.The American regulator has approved the medicine for children weighing at least 35 kilograms (77 pounds) who have never taken HIV therapy and HIV-infected adults whose HIV-1 virus is currently suppressed.The drug, not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment, will also carry a ‘Boxed Warning’ alerting patients and healthcare providers that the drug can cause a buildup of lactic acid in the blood and severe liver problems, both of which can be fatal. The ‘Boxed Warning’ also states that Genvoya is not approved to treat chronic hepatitis B virus infection.The drug should not be prescribed with other antiretroviral products as it may have drug interactions with a number of other commonly used medications.","['hiv1', 'fda', 'hiv', 'approved', 'virus', 'drug', 'patients', 'usfda', 'lakh', 'tenofovir', 'india', 'effects', 'breakthrough', 'approves', 'fewer']","NEW DELHI: A new treatment for HIV infection has been approved by US federal regulators which does not have the side effects associated with other drugs used to fight the virus that causes AIDS.

In fact, doctors and NGOs dealing with HIV+ adolescents are faced with new problems, such as how to explain and make HIV-affected children understand that they need to lead a controlled life as they become adults. That they will not be able to enjoy life on par with their counterparts. Many of them think “being HIV” means they will die soon and are in a hurry to live life to the fullest extent such as partying hard or being in a relationship.

Dr Vanda Viegas, senior medical officer at ART center located in Goa medical college (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, said though they have had good results with children, who were put on ART since the centre started in the year 2005, they are now posed with more complex problems. “The problem is getting more complicated as most are orphans brought up in the orphanages and are now on their own,” she said.

They have similar urges and desires like other adolescents of their age, but, the only difference is that they have a deadly ailment. There is also a tendency among HIV-positive children to give up education once they learn about their disease. “They want to freak out and do everything possible before death catches up with them,” said Viegas.

Though some may be keen to do higher studies, she said they might not excel for the disease is likely to affect their IQ. Few are into college education, nonetheless. Peter Borges, secretary, Positive People, an NGO working for people afflicted with HIV/AIDS, said life for such children is not easy. Last week, a three-day workshop was held in Valpoi for HIV children,, who were informed about their ailment and were counselled on various aspects. They were also informed about various career options and how to go about it, and also given tips on stress management.

A counsellor, who has been counselling HIV patients, for a while, said counselling children with HIV is a tough job. Children with no parents or parents or a guardian going astray are high once they grasp the magnitude of their disease fully. “They want to be like other youth. Though we do warn them about perils of their action, we suspect some get into relationship without revealing to their partners about their ailment,” he said.

Viegas said, in recent times, she has come across three-four cases wherein relatives of HIV-positive girls got them married outside Goa. “In none of the cases, the groom or his family was informed about the HIV status of the bride,” she pointed out.

The end result has been tragic. After marriage, the girls stopped taking ART to hide the disease, and consequently progression of HIV virus in them was faster.

“They wanted to hide their ailment from their families, but, the arrangement didn’t work. They were thrown out by their respective families,” she pointed out. When some reported back at the ART center, they were in stage four, with full blown AIDS.","['various', 'ailment', 'life', 'getting', 'hiv', 'complex', 'goa', 'disease', 'virus', 'ngos', 'informed', 'teens', 'art', 'children', 'docs', 'tackling']","PANAJI: Although antiretroviral therapy (ART), a medication to decelerate the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has proved effective for over 250 HIV+ children in Goa, the problem is far from over.

""It's a hard three letters to absorb. It's a turning point in one's life,"" the 50-year-old actor said. Here are things you should know about Sheen’s HIV disclosure.

1. The Blackmails Sheen said he made the announcement to end a smear campaign and extortion efforts. Sheen said he's trusted the diagnosis with people he thought he could confide in, but has paid out upwards of $10 million to keep the illness a secret.

2. Clueless about the virus Sheen said he was diagnosed roughly four years ago, but doesn't know how he contracted the virus. ""It started with what I thought was a series of crushing headaches,"" he said. ""I thought I had a brain tumor. I thought it was over.""

3. Confessions

He also insisted it was ""impossible"" that he knowingly transmitted the virus to others. While he admitted to having unprotected sex with two people since the diagnosis, both were informed ahead of time and have been under the care of his doctor. But Sheen dismissed the idea that he engaged in high-risk behaviors.

4. HIV +, not AIDS HIV is the virus that leads to AIDS, which has no cure. But ""Charlie does not have AIDS,"" said the actor's physician, Dr. Robert Huizenga, an associate professor of clinical medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles. While an HIV-positive diagnosis used to be considered a death sentence, and there still is no cure, medical advancements have helped turn it into a manageable illness. However, antiviral drugs must be taken for a lifetime.

5. Medications

Sheen revealed he takes four pills every day, and his doctor said the main battle facing the actor is not related to HIV, but relapsing into substance abuse problems or entering into depression related to his diagnosis. ""Magically, somehow in the midst of incredible personal mayhem, he's managed to continue to take these medications,"" Huizenga said.

6. Public Support Sheen said he hopes by going public with the diagnosis, it will help dispel the stigma of HIV. ""I have a responsibility now to better myself and to help a lot of other people and hopefully with what we're doing today others will come forward and say, 'Thanks, Charlie,'"" he said.

7. Decided to reveal the family Sheen said he told ex-wives Denise Richards and Brooke Mueller about the diagnosis when he found out. He also shared the news recently with his oldest daughter. ""It hit her hard, but she recovered. She's tough like her dad,"" he said.

8. TV journey Sheen rose to become one of Hollywood's best-known actors through a series of memorable movie roles including 'Wall Street' and 'Red Dawn'. In more recent years, however, his public persona was shaped by a public meltdown during his 2011 feud with the creator of 'Two and a Half Men', the television series that helped him become the highest-paid television actor at the time. In the end, Sheen was fired from the show. He told Lauer that his behavior at the time had little to do with his diagnosis.

9. Regrets Sheen admitted that period was not one he looks back fondly on. ""There's a lot out there I'm not proud of. You can only hear 'winning' in the streets so many times,"" he said.

But this isn’t the first time a celeb has made such an announcement; there are others who are living with the life threatening disease, and most importantly, helping others cope with it too.The former NBA star was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1991 and since then he has not only controlled the virus from progressing into AIDS through strict medical and exercise regime, but has also become one of the most vocal activists lending support to HIV infected people. Immediately after Sheen announced that he’s HIV positive, Magic Johnson tweeted: “I wish @CharlieSheen and his family the best. With the advancement in treatments and medicine he can fight this disease and live a long life. In breaking his silence, I hope he joins me in educating the world about HIV/AIDs.”The former Frankie Goes to Hollywood frontman was diagnosed with the illness in 1991 and thought he would be the latest in a long line of famous faces who fell victim to AIDS. However, he has fought for his health tooth and nail and survived. Although it’s not exactly been a bed of roses. He confessed in an interview: “I live like a nun. I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, I haven’t done for years. I take copious amounts of vitamins and medications. I do everything possible to support my health. But I’m not whining about it, and I never will.”Olympic diver Greg Louganis was diagnosed with HIV at 28 and he has gone on record to say that he didn’t think he would survive beyond 30. Fit and fine at 55, now he has put the criticism levied at him for his head injury in 1988 Olympics behind him, wherein he was accused of putting divers to the risk of HIV. It cost him dearly with no sponsor willing to support him. Today, Louganis, a staunch supporter of those fighting HIV/AIDS, is going all out to support Sheen. “It can happen to anybody. Viruses are indiscriminate and opening up the dialogue and especially being in the public’s eye is a positive thing,” he said in an interview.Mexican-American fashion designer Mondo Guerra has been breaking barriers and stigmas regarding living with HIV ever since coming out as positive five years ago on Project Runway. While the 38-year-old Denver native is very open about living with HIV now, it wasn’t always the case.“It was hard for me to have this revelation and tell my story because I was scared. I felt very ashamed.

The child's mother, ironically an NGO worker engaged in HIV awareness, has resolved that if her son does continue studies, it will be at Deepsikha or not at all. The grandmother, who is a Bengali teacher in the very school, had to undergo HIV test to prove she was not a carrier before being allowed to continue.Shaan's mother Sujata learned about his condition mid-January when he was tested after she herself had tested positive the previous month. Her husband Sanjit had earlier been detected HIV+ in May 2014. Though devastated by the test result, Sujata who is engaged in awareness on HIV and AIDS for an NGO decided to immediately inform the school headmaster on ethical grounds.“Since my son studies with others, it is important that the teachers know about it so that if he is hurt and suffers a cut leading to blood loss, he is handled carefully and does not infect others. Sanjib Naskar, the headmaster, was extremely nice and assured me that he would personally ensure that Shaan did not face any trouble,” she recounted.Life carried on as usual till June when Sujata received a bolt from the blue. Naskar called her one day and told her that her son could not study in the school any longer as other guardians were opposed to it.“I didn't even know that word had got around and everyone knew Shaan's condition.

But it is true that over 100 guardians signed a petition and submitted to me for Shaan's removal from the school,” he said.On an after-thought, Naskar added that the child's fees were also due for several months. Sujata acknowledged that fees had not been paid for several months but claimed it was because the headmaster had waived the fees.District magistrate PB Saleem said he was aware of the mother's complaint and had asked the block development officer to conduct a thorough enquiry into it to ascertain the facts. “Whatever be the case, the child's education must not be affected.

The friend from over two decades ago, was trying to give his old buddy de-addiction treatment. The HIV positive man is said to have done this to avenge this 'care' shown by his friend.

The incident occurred late on Sunday night when Zaheer Modan (37) was going to drop his HIV infected friend to his home in Juhapura when the latter pushed the syringe into Modan. Feeling the pain, Modan asked his friend about it and later found the used syringe from the man's pockets. The drug-addicted man also confessed to having pinched the syringe.

According to Modan, Ehsan (name changed) was his friend for 22 years. Five years ago, Ehsan went to New Zeeland for work but he had started consuming hashish and other drugs there. Under the influence of drugs, he once fought with his employer and landed in jail for two years. After completion of his sentence, the New Zealand government deported Ehsan to India.

Ehsan did not leave his drug habit. He soon started taking drugs using syringes. His father died from the shock and his mother went insane. She was later taken to New Zealand by Ehsan's sister.

Modan stayed with Ehsan like a family-member and even admitted his friend to a de-addiction centre a couple of time. Ehsan did not stay the course and left the treatment programme without completing it.

Modan said Ehsan came to his house two days ago and told him that he had started working with the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), but as he was not paid for two months, he had vandalized his employer's office which led to a police complaint being lodged against him. He pleaded with Modan to help him get anticipatory bail.

On Sunday Modan had advised Ehsan to go to the concerned police station and assured him that they would secure his bail later. Modan again advised him to get over his addiction if he really wanted to avoid troubles in his life. After their conversation, Ehsan asked Modan to leave him at a rickshaw-stop on his bike. According to Modan, a common friend had once told him to let Ehsan remain in jail for some time so that he could leave his addiction. Ehsan had kept this in mind, and it led him to commit the heinous act.","['later', 'syringe', 'hiv', 'used', 'friend', 'ehsan', 'man', 'drugs', 'leave', 'started', 'modan', 'backstabs']","AHMEDABAD: In a bizarre incident, an HIV infected man, a drug addict, plunged his used syringe into his friend's backside.

Till now, in India, only those with a CD4 cell count of less than 350 are started under the ART programme. The NACO, for the first time in over a decade, has decided that the lifesaving antiretroviral drugs will now be offered to even those with a slightly higher CD4 count of 500. CD4 cell count is a crucial marker of how aggressively the virus is destroying the body’s immune system.

“We have to look into the evidence of starting ART for all. More than evidence, it is operational feasibility, finances, human resource and how the ART centres will cope with the increased load of more patients,” said Dr BB Rewari, national programme officer (ART), NACO. On WHO’s recommendations, he said the guidelines are never meant to be adopted immediately. “It is expected to take a year or two,” he said.

With the tweaking of CD4 requirement, over 2-3lakh HIV patients, who earlier did not qualify for the free ART therapy, are likely to be brought under its ambit. Currently, only 8 lakh people in the country are on the ART programme, even though the total number of people living with HIV in India is estimated to be 21 lakh.

Physicians firmly believe that the way forward is early initiation of ART in all adults, adolescents and children with HIV. Dr George Oomen, infectious diseases specialist, said there is ample evidence to show that people who have started ART at their highest CD4 count, be it 750 or 1,000, do best.

Head of medicine at Parel’s KEM Hospital Dr AR Pazare reiterated, “That is the way world is treating HIV. Why wait for the person to become too sick or for his CD4 count to fall so much?” He said early ART can not only stop progression of disease but also cut down on transmission.

Parallel to the CD4 debate is that of providing oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent acquisition of HIV. Ashok Row Kavi of Humsafar trust, that works with men having sex with men, said PrEP has been in use in India for the last few years, but its inclusion in national programme may not be a reality soon. “There is an ideological debate on whether to provide ART to gay men as a preventive drug or first reach out to all women and kids,” he added. Rewari said PrEp is being tried as a pilot study among female sex workers in Chennai, Mysore and Kolkata.","['hiv', 'cd4', 'programme', 'patients', 'naco', 'national', 'art', 'prep', 'feasible', 'india', 'count', 'drugs']","MUMBAIThe National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) has made it clear that India is not ready to adhere to WHO’s recent recommendation of providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all HIV patients regardless of their disease stage.

Today, the awareness is massive and everyone knows about ways of prevention.""Mumbai currently has over 30,000 people living with the disease. A senior NGO member , who worked with FSWs in Kamathipura, said the disease is no longer a death sentence. ""We probably don't even know how many women must have died of AIDS. It is a rare thing today."" But a doctor said the Indian program faces problems that government officials aren't ready to accept. so far.""Less than a tenth of those who need second -line HIV drugs access them under the government programme. These patients will not only develop further resistance but even spread the disease in the community,"" hes aid. He added the happy picture could crumble in a few years at the rate it's progressing.

HIV among the city's general population fell from 3.6% in 2013-14 to 3% in 2014-15.But the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) that manages health programmes for HIV+ AIDS people has been managing with a third of its annual budget of Rs 25 crore.

The NACO, for the first time in over a decade, has decided that the lifesaving antiretroviral drugs will now be offered to even those with a slightly higher CD4 count of 500. CD4 cell count is a crucial marker of how aggressively the virus is destroying the body's immune system. “We have to look into the evidence of starting ART for all. More than evidence, it is operational feasibility, finances, human resource and how the ART centres will cope with the increased load of more patients,“ said Dr BB Rewari, national programme officer (ART), NACO. On WHO's recommendations, he said the guidelines are never meant to be adopted immediately . “It is expected to take a year or two,“ he said.With the tweaking of CD4 requirement, over 2-3lakh HIV patients, who earlier did not qu alify for the free ART therapy are likely to be brought under its ambit. Currently , only 8 lakh people in the country are on the ART programme, even though the total number of people li ving with HIV in India is esti mated to be 21lakh.Physicians firmly believe that the way forward is early initiation of ART in all adults, , adolescents and children with HIV . Dr George Oomen, infec tious diseases specialist, said there is ample evidence to show that people who have started ART at their highest CD4 count, be it 750 or 1,000, do best.Head of medicine at Parel's KEM Hospital Dr AR Pazare reiterated, “That is the way world is treating HIV . Why wait for the person to become too sick or for his CD4 count to fall so much?“ He said early ART can not only stop progression of disease but also cut down on transmission.Parallel to the CD4 debate is that of providing oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent acquisition of HIV. Ashok Row Kavi of Humsafar trust, that works with men having sex with men, said PrEP has been in use in India for the last few years, but its inclusion in national programme may not be a reality soon. “There is an ideological debate on whether to provide ART to gay men as a preventive drug or first reach out to all women and kids,“ he added. Rewari said PrEp is being tried as a pilot study among female sex workers in Chennai, Mysore and Kolkata.","['hiv', 'cd4', 'programme', 'patients', 'naco', 'national', 'art', 'prep', 'feasible', 'india', 'count', 'drugs']","The NACO, for the first time in over a decade, has decided that the lifesaving antiretroviral drugs will now be offered to even those with a slightly higher CD4 count of 500.

Agricultural labourers and housewives were among the majority to be infected, highlighting the need for strengthening the HIV programme, which is going through a severe fund crunch.An analysis by the Maharashtra State Aids Control Society ( MSACS ) found that young people contributed to 42% fresh infections, while 6% were adolescents. It showed that 28,925 people tested positive for HIV out of the 21.37 lakh tested. Despite a constant decline in new infections across the state, young adults and adolescents, particularly in rural pockets, continue to be the most vulnerable due to lack of adequate knowledge or access to it.Women accounted for 56% new infections, while it was 43% among men and 1% in the transgender community. But the trend in Mumbai is the opposite, where most infections are still seen in men, and only 36% are detected in women. The study showed how education played a pivotal role in an individual getting the infection. About 29% who contracted the virus were illiterate and 35% had primary education. The graph dropped to 28% among those who completed secondary education and to 8% for those with college degrees and above.Infectious disease consultant Dr Om Srivastava said people in their early teens and pre-20s are the most vulnerable due to limited access to information or resources. “There is an element of irresponsibility for those beyond 20-22 as they have access to funds, resources and information,” he said. Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors ( MARD ) president Dr Sagar Mundada said pre-marital testing should be promoted on a larger scale.The highest infection (42%) was detected in the 36-50 age group. Incidentally, a year-on-year increase in this age group has been noted in Kolhapur. HIV in the 51-60 age group stood at 8% and among senior citizens 3%. Dr Shobhna Tehra of MSACS said, “The disease is well under control. Our testing has doubled and infections have halved.” Fresh infections have declined by 45% over the last five years in the city. Among the newly-infected, 78% are aged 15-49, said Dr Shrikala Acharya, additional project director, Mumbai District Aids Control Society ( MDACS ). Around 93% of the infections were due to unsafe sex.But an expert said, “The cloud of uncertainty has to be cleared from the programme that is struggling with demotivated workers and high attrition.” The MSACS has received only Rs 11.89 crore for the year despite having an approved budget of Rs 104.73 crore from the National Aids Control Organisation ( NACO ).","['worst', 'hit', 'mumbai', 'hiv', 'youngsters', 'msacs', 'dr', 'infections', 'maharashtra', 'mahas', '201415', 'young', 'education', 'control', 'group']","Mumbai: Young people in Maharashtra aged 18-35 accounted for a substantial number of new HIV infections in 2014-15.

When her husband – who works in Mumbai to provide for his family – came back home this Diwali, she insisted on an HIV test before he entered home. But, her husband wouldn’t agree. So, Anita decided he would not let him share her bed till he was in Udaisarai.Vidya, another resident of this village and a mother of two, too would not allow her husband Ram Kishore enter home till a blood test showed he was HIV negative.Not that Anita and Vidya were not happy that their husbands were home for Diwali. But, they were scared that they could get with them more them the money and Diwali gifts for all. They were afraid the men may get them disease and death – carrying back home with them the deadly HIV.The women in this village, where most make members work in Mumbai for a living, have united and are fighting this virus in a unique way: They are making the menfolk – through persuasion and even force – under a test to check for HIV as soon as they reach the village from Mumbai.Their fears aren’t misplaced. For, Udaisarai was like any other village in Uttar Pradesh – surviving on income from agriculture and money orders from men working in Mumbai and other cities in western India – till a screening camp 10 years ago made their world turn topsy turvy.Results of blood tests in the camp revealed most of the males were carrying the deadly virus.The village, with a population … and with members from about 200 homes working in other states, has lost as many as 44 people in the past decade.With death staring them in the face, women have taken strong steps. And, if the wives are ensuring HIV tests for husbands and safe sex, they are being supported by their mothers-in-law and sisters-in-law.“We are helping them save themselves from the scourge of infection and stigma. This Diwali, the women told the men to get themselves tested for HIV when the returned home,” said Gyan Swaroopa, an anganwadi worker who has played a key role in spreading awareness in the village.It was Vidya who took the lead and made her husband undergo a blood test at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre at the Fatehpur district hospital.“I have seen members of families which got infected die one by one. Even medicines do not work. The trauma is unbearable. So, I asked my husband to get himself checked,” said Vidya.But not all spouses are cooperative. Anita had to struggle to make her husband take the test. “I did not let him into my room for two days as he refused to take the test. I even did not let him share my bed for the rest of the days,” she said.“It was my mother-in-law who made him agree, reminding him of the deaths village have died. Village elders too convinced him and he donated his sample before leaving for Mumbai. The report is awaited,” she added.When Sangeeta’s husband came home for Diwali, it was her sister-in-law, who herself had lost her husband, who convinced him for the test. Sangeeta’s family heaved a sigh of relief when he turned out to be HIV negative. Sangeeta had stopped communicating with her husband till he agreed.But, when Rekha , who was married just about six months ago, could not convince her husband for the test, she ensured that he used condoms.But not all had it easy. When another resident Rani Devi insisted that her husband underwent a test, he retorted: “Tum humko bataogi ki kya karna hai (Will you tell me what I should do?).”ASHA worker Karuna Devi said threat of importing HIV infection fromMumbai still looms over the hamlet. Village head Dharam Raj revealed that at least 250 residents from 200 families worked in Mumbai and came back home only on festivals.“No one knows what these men do when they are far away, living alone. We counsel youth and men when they leave Fatehpur for work. The stand taken by the women of the village is laudable,” said village pradhan Dharam Raj.Elders who work in Mumbai also keep an eye on the younger men. “Instead of staying on the streets, we get together and pool in money to rent common rooms. This has minimized men visiting commercial sex workers,” said Ramesh Kumar , who has been working in Mumbai since 1999.Social organisations working in HIV prevention in the village are also helping empower women.

Blood transfusion also took place there. However, it was later revealed that the thalassaemic children were HIV positive and several of them had passed away since 2011. Parents of 34 such thalassaemic kids fought a long legal battle and finally sought further probe after CBI filed a closure report claiming that there could be various reasons behind the thalassaemic kids contracting HIV.The court agreed with arguments put forth by their counsel Paresh Waghela in case of three girls, who got treatment only at Junagadh civil hospital and obtained blood from Sarvodaya Blood Bank. The question raised was how these three contracted HIV. CBI found one blood donor with HIV positive, whose blood led to one child being infected with HIV after a few months. When the picture was so clear, why CBI did not fix liability on any authority at the hospital or blood bank and nobody was held responsible, the Waghela had argued. CBI also did not inquire beyond 529 persons out of the total 1,229 identified donors.","['kids', 'hospital', 'contracting', 'hiv', 'blood', 'probe', 'orders', 'thalassaemic', 'cbi', 'report', 'court', 'transfusion']","AHMEDABAD: A special CBI court on Monday ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to carry out further probe and nail criminal liability in connection with thalassaemic kids contracting HIV through blood transfusion at the Junagadh civil hospital.

On the one hand, the prevalence of HIV among various vulnerable groups has been coming down in the state. On the other, there seems to be a reduction in the central government funds to NACO (National AIDS Control Organisation) for AIDS control programmes and IEC activities (information, education and communication) undertaken through the various SACS (State AIDS Control Society).According to officials of the AP State AIDS Control Society (APSACS), in 2014-15, 32,190 new HIV cases were identified in the state with Guntur, East Godavari and Krishna being the most vulnerable districts mainly due to presence of high number of migrants and truckers. Between April to September 2015, 4,00,090 got tested, out of which 12,742 were confirmed as HIV positive in AP. Currently, 1,28,760 people are living with HIV and are under medication in AP, among which 11,566 are from Vizag district. ""In accordance with the theme of 'Getting to Zero- Zero New HIV Infections, Zero Stigma and Discrimination, Zero AIDS Related Deaths', the overall incidence of HIV/AIDS is coming down in the state but we still don't have a comparative statistics yet as the entire data of the combined state is with Telangana and we are trying to get the AP data post bifurcation. Even then, if we compare the overall prevalence among the high risk groups at present with those three-four years ago, we find that in almost all cases, the prevalence rate has come down,"" stated additional project director (APD) of APSACS Rajendra Prasad.""In ante-natal women, the prevalence rate is 0.1% now as compared to more than 1.5% three-four years earlier. Similarly, in female sex workers, it has come down from 8% to 4% and in MSMs (men who have sex with men) it's 8% as compared to 10% three years ago. Only in case of Injectable Drug Users (IDUs), the cases have gone up from 8% to 10%. We are trying to implement employer-need models in industries to generate awareness among workers too. We also feel the need for generation of continuous awareness and more IEC activities, which has slowed down,"" Prasad said.Speaking on IEC and other issues, an official from Naco working with State Aids Control Society, requesting anonymity, said, ""There's some problem regarding availability of funds to fight AIDS. The combined state of AP-Telangana got Rs 115 crore in 2014. But this year, only Rs 94 crore has been given by the Centre. In fact, the central government has asked the respective state governments to contribute 20 per cent of the funds. Given the fund crunch in the two states, such a move may hamper AIDS control programmes. Even IEC activities need to be continued without gaps because today's children would be tomorrow's youth and therefore a sustainable approach is needed to curtail incidence of HIV. Any neglect at this juncture would escalate the incidences. Since the last one year, the supply of condoms and drugs are also erratic.""Additional district medical and health officer of Vizag (ADMHO - AIDS and Leprosy) Dr Ronanki Ramesh said that there had been some fund issues after bifurcation and the budget has not been finalised yet.

Without a solid safe framework, the body experiences difficulty fending off malady.HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It is the virus that can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS. HIV is a virus spread through certain body fluids that attacks the body’s natural immune system. The damage to the immune system makes it harder and harder for the body to fight off infections and some other diseases. Here are a few signs and symptoms of HIV which you should look out for.One symptom that comes in the very beginning is fever known as Acute Retroviral Syndrome (ARS). Fever is ordinarily accompanied with symptoms like tiredness and body torment.At the point when the infection enters the blood, the vulnerable immune system is hit. Likewise, aggravation because of poor immunity causes exhaustion and fatigue.Rash is the most common symptom of HIV. For a person with HIV, the skin can become extremely sensitive to irritants and sunlight. This effect can show up at the beginning or at a later stage. On the off chance that the skin rash isn't effortlessly treated then it could be because of the HIV infection The people suffering from HIV or those who have just fallen sick with HIV generally lose weight rapidly due to the above symptoms.Dry cough should be immediately treated with common treatments. If it is done so, this persistent coughing can lead to pneumonia, which is a sign of the HIV virus.These squeamish inclinations which are not effectively treated could suggest HIV contamination.Lymph nodes shape some portion of the resistant framework which is our immune system. When the immune system is tainted by HIV virus, the lymph nodes get inflamed giving a sign of HIV disease.HIV infected individuals also experience night sweats. This symptom is very similar to women entering menopause.There are a few ways which may help you beat the HIV virus. Here we have mentioned those natural ways that you can add into your daily life and habits to stay safe from the HIV virus.Fast for at least 1 day a week. Drink only the concoction made of distilled water, lemon juice and honey.Eat predigested proteins for maximum digestion. Products like soy milk contain soy protein and yogurt culture, and are great for health as well.Eat cultured proteins like yogurt made from soy milk, that is easily absorbed and digested, and contains acidophilus. This friendly flora produces lactic acid which destroys the bad bacteria.Take protein digestive enzymes if you eat hard to digest proteins like meat, eggs, fish or fowl.Eliminate those proteins from the diet that are hard to digest, like casein from dairy products and gluten’s from wheat and, coagulated proteins from like in fried meats.","['signs', 'soy', 'hiv', 'body', 'virus', 'symptoms', 'proteins', 'system', 'treated', 'immune', 'infection', 'symptom', 'main']","HIV (human immunodeficiency infection) is an infection that attacks our body's immune system, the body's natural protection framework.
