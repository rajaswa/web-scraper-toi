Guwahati's 35-year-old Junali (name changed on request), who lost her husband three years ago to HIV/AIDS, is among thousands of HIV-positive people in northeast India and elsewhere excited by the prospects of finding a good match through the website.""I am pinning all my hopes to find a genuine match on the proposed website. I want to live a life with dignity and want someone who is intelligent, sober, and caring,"" Junali told IANS.The websiteto be launched later this month at the behest of the Indian Network for People Living with HIV/AIDS (INP+) has already generated a lot of interest among HIV- positive people.""We have already got about 150 to 200 requests for membership despite the fact that the website is yet to be launched,"" Jahnabi Goswami, president of INP+, said.Goswami, 32, is one of the few women in India fighting to raise awareness about the disease. She belongs to an even smaller group of people who have publicly declared that they are HIV- positive.Membership to the website would be open only to people living with HIV/AIDS. ""Strict privacy would be maintained and only registered members will be able to log in and scan profiles of prospective partners,"" Goswami said.There are thousands of people living with HIV/AIDS interested in marriage and leading a normal life with dignity, but since they cannot get in touch with like-minded people, their dreams remained unfulfilled.""It is an excellent idea to have this website as marriages between an HIV- positive couple would enable them not only to lead a happy life but also to take care of and support each other, which is very important,"" S.I.

With his previous experience as chair of the AIDS Clinical Trials Group, reputedly among the most productive multinational research organizations working on HIV pathogenesis and therapy, Schooley was an important contributor to the two-day ART Symposium in the city organized by YRG Care over the weekend to discuss cutting-edge technology in the field.Speaking to TOI on Sunday about new scientific advances in the field, Schooley said, ""There are a host of approaches being adopted by researchers worldwide to try and eradicate HIV however the approaches using either enzymes or RNA to remove infected cells are ultimately the most hopeful and will be the least disruptive for the patient. Paula Cannon, a researcher from California, for instance, has been working on ways to identify HIV-infected cells called CD4 cells (so called because they have a molecule on the surface called CD4) which is a gateway for the virus. These cells have a second molecule called CCR5 which is a second door that the virus has to pass through. Now, she has created a way for the second molecule to be changed so that they virus cannot recognize it. In this approach, the virus stays outside the cell."" Elaborating on Cannon's research, he said she had been able to demonstrate it successfully in mice.""The next step will be to take people with HIV infection who have lymphoma and so, would need a bone marrow transplant for their tumours. She would treat the stem cells and hopefully the bone marrow so grafted would afford the patients' cells protection from HIV,"" Schooley said. Pointing out that this was an experiment that had to be done, he cited the example of a similar case but with a natural modification of the CCR5 molecule being reported in the New York Journal of Medicine about 18 months ago. ""After the HIV-infected individual underwent a bone marrow transplant from such a donor, no one could demonstrate the presence of HIV in the patient. So, there is certainly some preliminary support for her research,"" he said.Commenting on India's research potential, Schooley said that biotechnology was growing at an excellent pace in the country. ""There is some state of the art research work being carried out by YRG Care and some fantastically sophisticated research at National Aids Research Institute, Pune. In fact, the component sites that we have in Chennai and Pune are among the most productive. We are carrying out trials on the best drugs to use for HIV infections, treating people with drug failure and drug resistance and treating people suffering from HIV and Tuberculosis at the same time. There is a lot of important work being carried out over here. India is one of the best places for research activity worldwide,"" he added.","['hiv', 'schooley', 'hopeful', 'research', 'researchers', 'second', 'virus', 'called', 'cells', 'working', 'finding', 'molecule', 'marrow', 'cure']","These cells have a second molecule called CCR5 which is a second door that the virus has to pass through.

The hapless woman was thrown out by her husband after she had tested HIV+ during delivery of her baby last year. Although she got the infection from her husband but the latter refuses to keep her saying that he has no money to bear the cost of treatment. He has also kept the baby with him.“I knocked at every door possible, be it NGOs or government organisations but only got sympathies,” said Poonam while narrating how her husband snatched her four-month-old daughter from her and threw her out of the house. “With no money and means of livelihood, I first went to my parents but my father was also not ready to accept me. My mother, however, intervened and helped me in approaching various government agencies and NGOs for help. However, at all the places people only made promises but none helped,” she rued. Poonam only want a job so that she can be financially independent and can claim custody of her daughter.In her letter, Poonam has described how hundreds of HIV+ women like her who want to stand on their feet and fight stigma but are being pushed back by government agencies and NGOs who thrive on grants procured in the name of HIV/AIDS awareness and welfare. “I hope being a women chief minister will help me out,” said Poonam who signed the letter “one of your daughter”. A dejected Poonam has also said that she would be forced to commit suicide, if no help came from the chief minister. “ What option do I have...should I take to prostitution and infect others...or beg on streets... better to end life,” she said.Poonam was just 16 when she was married to one Rajesh, who works as salesman in a small firm. The marriage does not have a legal sanctity because she was minor at that time. She has studied till class XI, which is also not enough to get a job. “ I understand the limitations but I am only asking for a job, may be a peon or a counsellor at any AIDS awareness centre or any task which may earn enough to take care of myself,” she said. At present, she survives on little money her mother sends every month. During the day, she wanders on the streets looking for work and in the night finds shelter in railways and bus stations.The woman also knocked the door of the State Women Commission and State Aids Control Society as well as other NGOs working for HIV positive people but got only assurances. The episode has also exposed the poor state of affairs in government set up for providing relief and rehabilitation to abandoned HIV+ women and children. There are over 1000 NGOs, funded by the government and other national international organisations, working in the field of HIV/AIDS in UP but none have any shelter home, barring ‘Shanti Niketan’ run by the ‘Sisters of Saint Joseph’, a Christian missionary organisation, but it has limited capacity.The state has over 1.4 lakh HIV+ people, of which nearly 30% are widows who acquired infection from their husbands but after their death were disowned by in-laws. Many like Poonam are denied shelter by their parents as well. Some also have children. The only option for them is to lead a traumatised life and die in oblivion. Officers claim that government gives enough funds to the NGOs for the job. The Lucknow Network for People living with HIV and AIDS has been helping such widows but resources are limited. Members complain that NGOs take grants in the name of HIV/AIDS but have done more harm to victims than infection.","['hiv', 'ngos', 'money', 'shelter', 'poonam', 'job', 'dumped', 'organisations', 'husband', 'women', 'woman', 'seeks', 'help', 'state', 'cms']","The hapless woman was thrown out by her husband after she had tested HIV+ during delivery of her baby last year.

In India, over 60% of HIV-infected patients with a weak immunity system get infected with TB and ultimately die of it.Scientists from Dartmouth Medical School (DMS) have reported results of their clinical trial of this new vaccine against TB -- Mycobacterium vaccae (MV) -- in the January 29 online issue of the journal AIDS. The study will be published in the March print issue of the journal.Principal investigator Ford von Reyn from DMS said, ""Since development of a new vaccine against TB is a major international health priority, especially for patients with HIV infection, we and our Tanzanian collaborators are very encouraged by the results of the study.""The vaccine is a type known as an inactivated, whole-cell mycobacterial vaccine and is expected to be economical to produce and distribute.Von Reyn described the trial as a ""significant milestone -- the first to demonstrate that any type of vaccine can prevent an infectious complication of HIV in adults"".He added that the next steps are to improve the manufacturing methods to support the production of the larger quantities of the TB vaccine needed for further studies and subsequent clinical use.Health ministry officials in Delhi say the vaccine gives tremendous hope to India which has a huge burden of both TB and HIV patients.Of the over two million HIV-infected Indians, over 10% are expected to have full blown AIDS. Every AIDS patient has 15% chance every year of developing TB, which shows that every AIDS patient will develop TB some time in his life.""That's why under India's latest AIDS control programme, we are dealing with TB and HIV simultaneously. When people become infected with TB and AIDS, it is almost always an irreversible formula,"" ministry officials said.Since newly-infected HIV patients risk contracting TB almost immediately, investigators are targeting a strategy for immunization with MV before patients need to start taking antiretroviral drugs.The scientific team at Dartmouth began Phase-I human studies with MV in the United States in 1994 and demonstrated that a multiple-dose series of MV was safe in both healthy subjects and patients with HIV infection.The group then conducted Phase-II studies in larger groups of adults in Zambia and in Finland. In the Zambian trial, researchers found that MV boosted immune responses against TB that had first been primed in childhood with the current TB vaccine, BCG.Subsequently, the DarDar group received NIH funding to conduct the large Phase-III efficacy trial among HIV-infected patients with prior BCG immunization in Tanzania.HIV patients are particularly vulnerable to TB because their immune systems are compromised. The vaccine works by boosting the immune responses of patients who have already been given the BCG vaccine earlier in life.","['hiv', 'mv', 'aids', 'tb', 'hivinfected', 'patients', 'vaccine', 'getting', 'trial', 'prevent', 'shot', 'studies', 'immune']","NEW DELHI: A vaccine to protect HIV patients from contracting tuberculosis (TB) and ultimately dying of it has finally become a reality.After a seven-year-long trial in Africa, scientists have for the first time developed a vaccine that was succesful in reducing the rate of definite TB infection by almost 39% among 2,000 HIV-infected patients in Tanzania.TB is the biggest killer of HIV-infected patients in the world.

A resident of the central suburbs, he proudly announces unlike many HIV-positive patients, he has never been bedridden by frequent bouts of illnesses.He credits his health to his family and hisemployer, the Indian Railways, who have been supportive ever since he was diagnosed with HIV while randomly donating blood at a donation camp way back in 1997.The unusual patient scaled another height three months back; he became the first HIV-positive person in Maharashtra to undergo a kidney transplant . In the stigma-ridden world of HIV/AIDS, 45-year-old Jha's story holds out hope for the two-million-plus Indians living with HIV.In Jha's case, his 64-year-old mother Sitara donated one of her kidneys to her first-born son. ""I just want to see my child living healthily next to me,"" she said over the phone from Benares.The transplant is a milestone of sorts. Not surprisingly then, Jha's nephrologist Dr M Bahadur, transplant surgeon Shailesh Raina and medical consultant Dr Om Srivasatava are ecstatic with his progress since the transplant was carried out at Jaslok Hospital last November 26.""This is the first time in Maharashtra that a HIV-positive person has got a transplant. It needs experienced specialists to manage the patient carefully so as to ensure that his body doesn't reject the donor organ while ensuring that the HIV infection doesn't flare up,"" Bahadur, who has been treating Jha since 2006, said.Admitting that it had indeed been a challenge to handle a HIV-positive patient, Srivastava said that the right medical environment (as in a super-speciality hospital like Jaslok), right protocol and medicines were needed for such transplants. ""If the HIV-positive patient's CD4 count is adequate and his viral load is negative, then he can safely undergo a transplant,"" added the Jaslok doctors.Worldwide, too, transplants for HIV-positive patients are a relatively new concept. In 2004, the US reported about a 100-odd liver and kidney transplants for HIV-positive patients.The man himself is calm. ""My HIV status was detected in 1997 and my kidney failure in 2006."" He was on dialysis for three years before doctors realised that transplant would be the only hope for him. ""In my 13 years with HIV, I took only 77 days of leave but I needed over three months of leave for the kidney transplant and the minor problems that cropped up after it,"" he said.Jha also believes that his employer, the Railways, played a great role in his ""healthy but HIV"" status. ""I have had access to antiretroviral drugs for the past 10 years. I was never discriminated against or passed up for promotion at my workplace. My dialysis would cost tens of thousands of rupees but the railways always paid up. They even paid for my transplant,"" added the father of two.Dr Harsh Jauhari, one of the seniormost nephrologists in the country, said that while a couple of HIV-positive patients had undergone transplants in India, little was chronicled about these special patients. ""There is a confidentially clause with HIV-positive patients that cannot be tampered with. So it is likely that we don't know about all the transplants that have taken place in this category. But there is no denying that these patients need specialised care,"" added the Delhi-based Jauhari.Another senior doctor said there were several issues about safety about the medical staff involved as well that had not allowed HIV-positive transplants so far.Incidentally, a study published in the Archives of Surgery last year by the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine said that HIV-positive kidney transplant recipients could have the same one-year survival rates for themselves and their donor organs as those without HIV, if certain risk factors for transplant failure were recognized and tightly managed.According to the report, ""HIV patients were earlier not considered transplant candidates as researchers thought that the survival rates after transplantation were greatly compromised by the disease, which cripples the body's immune system. Also, transplant patients take drugs that suppress their immune systems in order to prevent organ rejection, a regimen thought to further threaten their already fragile immune systems.""(The patient's name has been changed.)","['transplant', 'hiv', 'op', 'medical', 'patients', 'hivpositive', 'transplants', 'kidney', 'jhas', 'rare', 'patient', 'gets', 'railways', 'india']","""This is the first time in Maharashtra that a HIV-positive person has got a transplant.

One per cent of the city's 15,000 street children (in the age group of 5-14) are HIV-positive, but were not aware of the fact that they were carrying the deadly virus, reveals a survey conducted by the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED), Kolkata.Most victims did not even know how the disease got transmitted or its symptoms and had contracted the lethal virus through sexual abuse, says the survey. While around 4% suffered from other sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis, nearly 10% of these youngsters faced sexual abuse before turning 16.Titled Non-tobacco Substance Use, Sexual Abuse, HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infection Among Street Children in Kolkata', the study was carried out across 58 municipal wards of the city. More than 550 street children, who have no family, were interviewed and observed from 2007 to 2009. Random blood samples were collected to check the prevalence of diseases like HIV, hepatitis B and sexually transmitted diseases. The results have left the team of researchers shocked.""One per cent of these children were HIV-positive which is a big number. Being marginalised and without any access to medical care, they will probably never come to know of their HIV status. Or, by the time they do, they will have infected others. This is an alarming situation since the urban homeless often act as a bridge between the infected population and those who are at risk. We need immediate intervention to check a potential epidemic,"" said Kamalesh Sarkar, deputy director, division of epidemiology, NICED. Sarkar led a five-member research team for the study.While no specific age of the HIV victims could be established from the random survey, all were below 16 years. Inquiring into the reasons behind the spread of the virus, the researchers found that most had faced sexual abuse. ""A minor percentage might have got the virus from sex workers. It is quite possible that they passed it on to others since both sexual abuse and promiscuity was common among street children. It is unlikely that any had got the virus from their parents,"" said Sarkar.The study reveals that while 26% of male street children faced sexual abuse before they turned 15, 13% of the girls who faced abuse were above 15 years. Around 13% of the boys who visited sex workers suffered from sexually transmitted diseases.""Without any shelter or protection, these children will continue to be vulnerable. Moreover, they had no idea of HIV or that they could end up carrying the virus and infect others. Since there has never been any such study in the past, it is difficult to say if the number is rising. But unless steps are taken, it will definitely spiral and pose a serious health hazard which we are probably not ready to deal with,"" said Baishali Bal, one of the researchers.Less than half of the street children got two square meals a day, more than 85% slept in public places and earned less than Rs 1,000 a month. Substance abuse, the study disclosed, was extremely high among them. Thirty per cent used non-tobacco substances like adhesives, brown sugar, cocaine and alcohol.NICED has proposed shelters and support centres for street children at railway stations. ""It is at places like stations and markets that they generally tend to camp in search of work and food.

The survey, comprising a sample of 721 MSM from 18 different cities in the state, found 9% of MSM to be HIV-infected.""The sustained campaign by the government about the use of condoms and its various awareness programmes for sex workers (the prevalence of HIV among them decreased from 9% in 2003 to 4.7% in 2007) and truck drivers have clearly shown results. But things remain unchanged as far as MSM and drug users are concerned,"" says Dr Sunil Suhas Solomon, senior medical officer and epidemiologist at YRGCARE, who presented the data at the 16th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Montreal last year.""MSM remain a hidden population in India primarily due to Section 377 of the IPC, which has historically criminalised sex between men, and also the societal and family pressures to marry. Hence, there is very little community-level data of HIV among MSM. So we used a technique called peer-driven recruitment, which uses MSM to recruit other MSM to arrive at the study sample,"" says Dr Solomon.The study also documented the existence of HIV epidemics among MSM in many smaller cities such as Tirunelveli, Ramanathapuram and Tuticorin, which are usually not included in the planning of interventions targeted at MSM. Also, more interesting was the finding that the prevalence of HIV and sexually transmitted infections among MSM who were married is double compared to MSM who were not married.""About 35% of our sample of MSM were married. The higher prevalence of HIV infection among MSM who were married could partially be explained by their nature to keep their same sex practices even more hidden. Consequently, they ended up having more male partners, which has been shown by many studies to be a strong risk factor for HIV infection,"" explains Dr Solomon.Sahodaran, an organisation that works with MSM, conducted a similary survey recently in association with the Tuberculosis Research Centre in Chetpet and found that 8% of MSM in Chennai were HIV infected. But Sunil Menon, who runs Sahodaran, says there is no tangible evidence to back such figures because the gay community still remains hidden. ""Maybe the figure is shown rising just because more people are testing now than they did before. So there is no way of saying whether the prevalence is increasing, decreasing or remains the same,"" says Menon.Says Dr Solomon, ""The current phase of the National AIDS Control Programme has initiatives targeting MSM. Only time will tell the effectiveness of these programmes but the government needs to be applauded for the fact that it recognizes HIV among MSM as an issue and is taking steps to address it. However, it is equally important to address issues related to the families (wives and children) of these marginalised populations who are also being placed at risk via their spouses' behaviors.""","['hiv', 'sex', 'survey', 'prevalence', 'dr', 'msm', 'shown', 'men', 'sample', 'rise', 'infection']","The survey, comprising a sample of 721 MSM from 18 different cities in the state, found 9% of MSM to be HIV-infected.

To explain what that means, here's a brief HIV family history: Most people who get HIV and proceed to AIDS are infected with a member of the HIV-1 family of viruses. HIV-1 is divided into groups; most AIDS-related strains of the virus come from group M. The groups are further subdivided into what are known as clades.Clade B is the form of group M HIV-1 most often found in the United States and western Europe, and the one that is probably best-studied to date. Clade C, the clade studied by the Caltech team, is ""the one that is devastating Africa and Asia,"" said Diskin. ""It's the one that probably causes the largest number of infections worldwide.""In order to uncover the structure of clade C gp120--and determine if the hypothesis about its similarities was indeed true — the Caltech team needed to crystallize the protein. That was no easy task. Turns out, says Diskin, the protein itself is not stiff enough for crystallization. And so the researchers created a complex of molecules consisting of a gp120 monomer, a CD4 receptor, and an anti-HIV antibody known as 21c.","['hiv', 'gp120', 'clade', 'hope', 'vaccine', 'hiv1', 'protein', 'c', 'structure', 'team', 'shot', 'unveiled', 'known']","""There's a tremendous continuing effort to develop a vaccine for HIV and most of those efforts use gp120.

28,7-7-2010,[],https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg,"PARIS: Lab work on mice has opened up a novel way of closing a gateway to the AIDS virus , according to a study published on Friday.The doorway in question is called CCR5 , a protein that helps the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) penetrate a cell, its first step before hijacking the cellular machinery and reproducing itself.Around a decade ago, scientists discovered that people who had a tiny gap in the genetic code for making CCR5 were surprisingly resistant to HIV infection and took more time to progress to AIDS.This gene variant, known as CCR5 delta 32, results in smaller CCR5 proteins, which prevents most strains of HIV from infecting the cell.Testing a theory, scientists in the US took immature haematopoietic cells—which make immune and red blood cells—from mice. They modified some of the cells, using a brand-new enzyme “cutter” to delete the famous CCR delta 32 section.As a result, when these cells matured and divided, they lacked the key code for making normal CCR5.The modified cells were reinjected back into the rodents, which were then exposed to HIV. Twelve weeks after infection, the animals had recovered their stock of immune T-cells and their levels of HIV were very low.But “control” mice that had not received the modified cells were highly infected and their immune systems weak.If the approach is found to be safe and effective on humans, it opens the way to creating a long-term generation of HIV-resistant T-cells in the body—in other words, a patient could suppress HIV without taking powerful antiretroviral drugs.The experiment headed by Paula Cannon of the University of Southern California , Los Angeles, and reported in the journal Nature Biotechnology, is the third avenue that has opened up for CCR5 investigators.Drugs that inhibit CCR5 are already being licensed as “salvage” therapy for patients whose immune systems have been crippled by HIV. Doctors are also testing in trials on volunteers a CCR delta 32 technique, but using T-cells as opposed to stem cells.“It’s a one-shot treatment if it works,” noted study co-author Paula Cannon, associate professor of molecular microbiology at the University of Southern California. In gene therapy, doctors try to coax the human body into doing something differently by tweaking its genetic structure. To treat HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, scientists have been experimenting with using gene therapy to boost the immune system.","['hiv', 'tcells', 'modified', 'virus', 'therapy', 'immune', 'cells', 'scientists', 'created', 'fight', 'using', 'ccr5']","They modified some of the cells, using a brand-new enzyme “cutter” to delete the famous CCR delta 32 section.As a result, when these cells matured and divided, they lacked the key code for making normal CCR5.The modified cells were reinjected back into the rodents, which were then exposed to HIV.

35,22-7-2010,['Kounteya Sinha'],https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg,"NEW DELHI: A simple blood test is now helping India identify the status of children born to HIV positive mothers as early as six weeks after their birth, instead of 18 months.Till recently, paediatricians in India, on detection of anti-HIV antibodies in children below 18 months, could never tell for sure whether they were already infected or the antibodies were transferred to them from their mother.Therefore, doctors couldn't even start the life-saving Anti-Retroviral Treatment -- the only effective way to treat HIV -- on them. This, according to National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), led to 33,000 new infants getting the infection every year from their HIV positive mothers.India, in March, rolled out the highly accurate DNA PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test in the four high prevalence states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra.Available in 767 Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) and 180 ART centres, the DNA PCR can test the blood sample of a child after it reaches six weeks of age and accurately say whether it is already infected with HIV or not.The antibody test available before March could only confirm the HIV status after the child reached 18 months of age.In the last three months, 45 children have been tested for HIV status. NACO hopes to roll out the test to 10,000 children born to HIV positive mothers by March next year.""As soon as the child of an HIV positive mother is older than six weeks, his or her blood sample is collected and transported to seven national labs for testing with DNA PCR which gives us a definitive diagnosis on the child's HIV status. The report is available in just a week,"" NACO's ART chief Dr B B Rewari told TOI before leaving for the International AIDS Conference in Vienna.Dr Rewari, who will present this data in Vienna, added, ""Usually, if such children aren't put on treatment, 50% of them die within the first year of birth if infected. So early diagnosis and treatment is vital.""Till now, India has detected 19,000 children with HIV.Unlike other tests, the HIV DNA PCR test does not rely on the presence of antigens or antibodies in the blood for diagnosis. Instead, it identifies genetic material by highlighting sequences of the virus within the subject's DNA.Experts say all babies born to mothers with HIV are born with HIV antibodies. Babies who are not infected lose their antibodies by the time they are about 18 months old. However, most babies can be diagnosed as either infected or uninfected by the time they are three months old by using DNA PCR test.""The PCR test is more sensitive than the HIV test, and is not used in the standard HIV testing of adults. It looks for the presence of HIV itself, not antibodies,"" a NACO official said.When a woman is tested HIV positive, she is offered special medical care to reduce the risk of her baby being infected. Some pregnant women with HIV decide to have their baby. Others choose to have a termination.""There are now very effective drugs that can reduce the risk of an HIV positive mother passing the virus to her baby in the womb or at birth. Delivery by elective Caesarean section also reduces the risk of a baby becoming infected. Beast-feeding in such cases increases the risk of the baby becoming infected,"" the official said.* An estimated 22.7 lakh Indians are infected with HIV* India has an HIV prevalence of 0.29%* It usually takes 10 years for HIV to become full blown AIDS* The first AIDS case in India was reported from Chennai, in 1986* Globally, more than 33 million people have AIDS or HIV, half of them women* Since the beginning of the epidemic in 1981, 60 million people have got infected with HIV and at least 25 million have died of AIDS","['hiv', 'positive', 'aids', 'children', 'blood', 'pcr', 'newborns', 'test', 'infected', 'helps', 'months', 'antibodies', 'status', 'identify', 'india']","NACO hopes to roll out the test to 10,000 children born to HIV positive mothers by March next year.

The drug can reduce a woman's chances of contracting HIV from an infected partner by 50% if used 12 hours before and after having sex.Interestingly, the gel had undergone a safety and acceptability trial on 100 women at National Aids Research Institute (NARI) in Pune in 2007. It can also reduce the risk of genital herpes by 51%.Being hailed as a major breakthrough globally, the CAPRISA trial followed 900 HIV-negative, sexually active South African women in the age group between 18 and 40.Two-and-a-half-years on, researchers found the gel reduced chances of HIV infection by 50% after a year and 39% after 30 months. The study revealed that those women -- who used the drug consistently nearly 80% of the time before having sex -- would be 54% less prone to infection.Health secretary K Sujatha Rao told TOI ""This is a major breakthrough, and will especially benefit India's 300,000-strong sex worker community involved in multi-partner sex. It will also help women who usually do not have the power to insist on condom use and fidelity, or to abandon partnerships that put them at high risk.""K Chandramouli, director general of National Aids Control Organisation. added, ""At present, India has 2.7 million HIV patients. We also record 1.7 lakh fresh cases of HIV every year, nearly 40% of which are women. Such a microbicide, once ready for implementation in our programme, will greatly benefit women.""According to NARI director Dr R S Paranjape, the gel underwent safety and acceptability study in India as well.""The preparatory work for the CAPRISA trial was conducted here along with the Microbicide Trials Network. The overall safety profile of the gel was good and it was well accepted by women. Presently, it provides 40% protection. The scientific community will now look at increasing this percentage,"" he explained.With a vaccine against HIV remaining elusive, scientists have for the past 20 years been looking for such an effective microbicide -- products such as gels, films, rings or creams that women could apply on their vagina to prevent HIV transmission.Finally, the breakthrough has happened, thanks to the microbicide that contains 1% Tenofovir.Tenofovir gel is an advanced second-generation HIV-specific microbicide that neither tries to kill the AIDS virus nor block it from entering the body as its predecessors. Instead, it is designed to prevent the virus from replicating when it comes in contact with an uninfected T-cell.Naturally, the virus will fail to survive for long to cause systemic infection.Women, who constitute 50% all new HIV cases globally, are also twice as likely as their male partners to contract HIV during unsafe sex. ""Tenofovir gel could fill an important HIV prevention gap by empowering women who are unable to successfully negotiate mutual faithfulness or condom use with their male partners,"" said study co- principal investigator Dr Quarraisha Abdool Karim. ""Eleven trials in the past 15 years have shown no change or even sometimes an increase in transmission rates. Tenofovir gel has a potential dual effect in preventing HIV. Since women with genital herpes are much more likely to become infected with HIV, the additional protection of tenofovir gel against herpes creates a second mechanism whereby the gel may have a bigger impact in preventing HIV,"" he explained.The gel is undergoing another Microbicide Trials Networks VOICE -- Vaginal and Oral Interventions to Control the Epidemic -- study that will provide evidence about the safety and efficacy of tenofovir gel used daily, irrespective of when participants have sex.Once this study is conducted, drug regulatory authorities will determine if the gel is safe and effective for HIV prevention. It may take another two years before public can use it.Michel Sidibe, executive director of UNAIDS, said, ""For the first time, we have seen results for a woman-initiated and controlled HIV prevention option.""","['vaginal', 'hiv', 'tenofovir', 'safety', 'aids', 'study', 'gel', 'sex', 'women', 'drug', 'microbicide', 'protection', 'offers', 'infection']","NEW DELHI: A vaginal gel can now protect women against HIV infection -- an innovation that scientists believe could be most crucial for reproductive health since the Pill.On Tuesday, scientists announced at the International Aids Conference in Vienna that they have successfully tested a gel, containing antiretroviral drug Tenofovir, which is usually taken as a tablet by HIV patients.

Their parents were thrown out of their native village in east UP.Construction site owned by their Chandigarh-based maternal uncle became their home after the death of their parents. Kids were made to work like labourers in lieu of two meals a day. But when their aunt came to know about them being HIV positive, she drove them out.The kids, in an attempt to return to their roots, reached Lucknow and were seen by policemen near Itaunja. The cops sent them to an orphanage and informed protection home authorities who sent them to Shanti Niketan of Lucknow, one of the few places in the country which takes care of AIDS orphans.Now 12, Suresh has been able to reason the treatment he got till he reached this home.

His comic-strip also says the same.""This is the basic message that needs to be disseminated across the society to ensure a future for kids like Sita and Suresh. People sensitive to their plight can help in re-integrating them with the society by improving their living conditions and ensuring economic and social autonomy,'' said Augustine Veliath of Unicef.Besides producing a tool to sensitise people and create awareness, the kids had a great time. ""We began with learning to make faces using alphabets O and T. While O becomes the outline of the face, eyebrows, nose and mouth are sketched out of the T,'' said Mohit, who actively participated in the workshop.Sharad Sharma, founder World Comics India who taught the kids how to draw, added that with a little practice, children switch over from simple faces to the ones carrying expressions.

Strangely, the health department has no figures of patients' dying of AIDS. The persons whose blood samples are tested include pregnant women, TB patients, sexual disease cases and suspected HIV cases referred by doctors from various hospitals.Bhusari urged people to avoid unsafe sex, used syringes, and transfusion of blood from professional donors as these are main ways of transmission of HIV. He also urged barbers to use new blades for each customer.","['hiv', 'pregnant', 'bhusari', 'blood', 'patients', 'samples', 'women', 'persons', 'months', 'district', 'cases', '2k', 'detected']","NAGPUR: As many as 2,223 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive cases have been detected in Nagpur district in the first seven months (January 1 to July 31) of this year.This figure includes 154 pregnant women.

An ongoing study by the KEM Hospital to find out the efficacy of ayurvedic drugs in improving the life expectancy of HIV positive patients has yielded some positive results.The medicine department of the hospital has been studying the potency of an ayurvedic drug on 700 HIV patients since April last year. After little more than a year, the institute found a significant boost in the count of CD4 cells in these patients, and also that it could probably push the initiation of anti-retroviral therapy (ART), known to have many side-effects, by a few years.The count of CD4 cells is directly proportional to the health of a person for these cells are the most important part of one's immune system. Anyone with less CD4 count is more prone to ailments as the body's defence mechanism starts giving way. The ART for HIV patients is started only after the CD4 count falls below 250.After administering the ayurvedic drug, the doctors found that the CD4 count in patients on an average went up from 448 to 546 within six months and up to 590 in a year's time. Besides, many patients had weight gains, increase in haemoglobin count and a sense of well-being.Claiming that it spells a lot of promise, head of medicine at KEM Hospital Dr A R Pazare said that not every patient who tests positive for HIV immediately qualifies for the ART drugs. ""Till a patient's CD4 count comes down to 250, we cannot prescribe ART. But patients show apprehension to go back home without medicines, especially after they are found positive for such a dreaded ailment,'' he said. Moreover, ART has side-effects like pain in abdomen, weakening of limbs and arms, swollen abdomen and distortion of facial features.Therefore, Pazare believes that patients could be prescribed some ayurvedic drugs with immuno-restorative properties that can delay the initiation of ART. ""Our assumption is that ayurvedic drugs with properties to strengthen immunity can delay the ART therapy by at least four years,'' said Pazare. ""And later, as the patient is put on ART, he can survive for a few more decades,'' he added. The KEM hospital study will be on for the next five years.However, the study solely focused on CD4 cells and did not check if the drug could bring down the viral load in a patient. Another hitch remains that ayurvedic drugs cannot be consumed simultaneously with the ART drugs.Speaking on the use of alternative therapies, head of ART department of JJ Hospital Dr Alaka Deshpande said nations across the globe were looking for indigenous medicines for HIV. ""Even in India, more systematic studies are required as there is no standardised data that talks about long-term effects,'' she said. Yet, she added that it may not be a bad idea to put patients on ayurvedic medicines with proven benefits till they are ideal candidates for ART.","['hospital', 'hiv', 'cd4', 'positive', 'hope', 'ayurvedic', 'patients', 'drugs', 'count', 'cells', 'ayurveda', 'art']","MUMBAI: With no cure in sight for the dreaded HIV, scientists across the globe are working towards drugs to prolong the life-span of afflicted patients.

In 1995, he applied for a work visa, forking out Rs 20,000 to an agent in Mumbai. A mandatory medical check followed and all the doctor would tell him was that ""something is wrong"" with his blood test results. He offered however to help suppress information for a ""commission"" of Rs 2,000.The expenses cost Harjeet a loan but he managed to fly to Saudi Arabia. On arrival, he was subjected to another medical test. To his shock, he was soon after whisked away to an isolated cell and jailed there for a day. The next day he was taken to a court which ordered his deportation. Harjeet, it seems, had tested HIV-positive .Back in India, Harjeet found that his wife had walked out of the family home with their two children. He was packed off to a care centre and left alone to deal with his situation. Severely depressed, Harjeet began getting multiple seizures that left him partially paralysed . He eventually recovered with a lot of support from the care centre. Today, Harjeet works with people who are HIV-positive and his life story has been documented by the International Aids Society (IAS).Harjeet is not alone. Thousands of people across the world have been deported or denied entry into countries because they are HIV-positive . This is despite the fact that stigmatising HIV-positive individuals is contrary to effective public health programming.Official data shows that 66 countries, territories and areas deny entry, stay or residence to HIV-positive individuals: of these, 26 deport migrants who test positive, seven refuse permission to stay beyond a certain time bar and six deny entry even for very short-term stay.""It is incomprehensible that HIV-related entry and residency restrictions still exist,"" says Kevin Moody, International Coordinator and CEO, Global Network of People Living with HIV. ""These restrictions are in blatant violation of human rights, they stimulate stigma and discrimination and actually hurt the response to the HIV epidemic.""India's health secretary, K Sujatha Rao, believes that irrational discriminatory laws should be lifted. ""In India, we don't have any laws against residence or visit by HIV patient,"" she points out.Many of these restrictions, says the IAS, were imposed in the early days of the epidemic, when there was a great deal of ignorance, fear and prejudice surrounding the subject. At that time, many governments saw these laws as an attempt to ""protect the public health"" and avoid the potential costs of care.The situation has, however, changed dramatically. There is a lot of information available about the disease and its prevention and the antiretroviral treatment can extend the life span of those who are HIV positive. Dr Helene Gayle, chief advisor to US president Barack Obama on HIV/AIDS , points out that these restrictive laws are no longer justified by concerns about public health.""Over 60 countries around the world have a variety of HIV-specific laws that restrict the entry, stay or residence of people living with HIV including Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Qatar, Oman, Russia, Colombia , South Korea, Yemen and Armenia ,"" says Dr Gayle. According to IAS executive director Craig McClure, scientific evidence shows that travel restrictions against those who are HIV-infected make for ineffective prevention tools. ""These laws are not consistent with current scientific knowledge, best practices in public health and humanitarian principles. They sustain a culture of exclusion, rights violations and marginalisation that impedes an effective response to the epidemic,"" says McClure.A WHO statement points out that such entry restrictions actually pressurise people into concealing their HIV infection from immigration authorities. They simply do not carry their HIV medicines on international trips. This could lead to drug-resistant HIV strains that are transmissible to other people. ""Furthermore, because drug resistance allows HIV to replicate in the body more freely, people with higher viral loads are also more infectious,"" says the statement.In the Asia and the Pacific region, countries have different kinds of restrictive laws for the HIV-affected . Singapore has an outright ban on all HIV-positive non-nationals for entry and immigration.Brunei targets HIV-positive foreigners for deportation. Australia requires HIV testing for permanent visa applicants over the age of 15. South Korea announced changes to its entry and immigration policy on January 1, 2010, but clarifications on its amended laws are still unclear.Some countries ask applicants to indicate their HIV status, some seek confirmation of HIV-negative test results and others insist on testing as a part of a mandatory medical exam for those seeking work permits.Things are however changing. The US, China and Namibia recently lifted their decades old travel laws against HIV-positive people. Hopefully, others will follow suit,and soon.","['hiv', 'laws', 'restrictions', 'hivpositive', 'test', 'harjeet', 'public', 'health', 'countries', 'positively', 'unwelcome', 'victims', 'entry']","Thousands of people across the world have been deported or denied entry into countries because they are HIV-positive .

With no medical treatment or hope of life, HIV positive children had little to look forward to. But more than two decades after the deadly disease was first detected in Chennai, several babies now have a chance of survival into adulthood thanks to medical regimen and better nutrition.When the Indian government began the national Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) for HIV patients in 2004, the programme was a godsend to many infected patients who had even given up on the idea of survival. ""Before the ART programme began, morbidity and mortality rate for HIV positive patients were high,"" says Dr P Manorama, chairperson of the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), who runs a home for HIV positive children in Chennai. Today, mortality levels have significantly reduced, from 13 % in 2005 to 8 % in 2010, according to the Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TANSACS).But all the medical and financial aid given by the government is not enough to offset the need for emotional support for the patients, especially children infected with HIV. According to statistics furnished by TANSACS, there are 11,197 children living with HIV in the state today and a sizeable number among them are adolescents.Daisy David of World Vision, an NGO working with HIV positive teenagers, says there is a large segment of children born with the disease, who have today reached their adolescence. ""Children living with HIV have the same exposure to society and media as other children,"" she points out. ""They too grow up with ambitions and desires. However, the discussions provided by the government are inadequate. They not only need counseling on career ambitions and how to battle life on the professional front, but also on the changes their bodies undergo and their own desires regarding sex, marriage and companionship.""Counselling HIV teenagers about marriage and companionship is rather difficult. ""There is need for counsellors who are equipped to handle all kinds of issues and emotions,"" says Dr.Lakshmibai, project director for Tamil Nadu Aids Initiative (TAI).""Many of them would like to marry non-infected persons, so there is always the issue of acceptance and rejection,"" says Daisy, who had recently attended a workshop for HIV-infected adolescents in Manipur. ""At Manipur, I met a teenaged boy who was battling rejection after his girlfriend found out he was HIV positive. They all had questions as to whether they could have sexual intercourse with non-infected persons, whether the babies born out of such a bonding would also be infected. The very fact that they needed to ask these questions shows that they are not receiving this kind of information or counselling.""The other issue that social workers stress on is a tailor-made counselling program for drug adherence.

The 25-year-old woman was admitted to KGH by a voluntary organisation on Aug 20 and she gave birth to a baby girl the very next day. While the baby is doing well, the doctors at the gynaecology ward stopped attending to the woman and the baby after coming to know about her HIV-positive status.Shockingly, the woman's husband, a daily wage worker, has also left her after learning that she was afflicted with the deadly virus.

And, Varanasi is supposed to be one of the main centres of HIV infected persons due to its migrant population.""In Varanasi district alone, there are over 1,000 persons infected with HIV and the number of such people goes above 11,000 in eastern parts of UP,"" informed secretary, Banaras Network of Positive People Living with HIV/AIDS Society (commonly known as BNP+), Sunil Seth. The network is spread over 30 districts of the state with active members to motivate and help HIV persons to lead a purposeful life.However, according to WHO report, over 34 million people are living with HIV and AIDS across the world. India alone, with 2.3 million cases of HIV, has the third highest number of HIV affected persons in the world.According to the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), around 3,22,521 persons were taking treatment for AIDS by April 2010. And, to give a new lease of life to such persons, the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre at the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) is playing a remarkable role. ""So far, 11,321 HIV patients have been registered with the ART Centre, Institute of Medical Sciences , BHU,"" said Dr Jaya of the centre. ""Around 4,500 patients are living on therapy and get regular medicines,"" she added. The ART at BHU is one of the 10 centres of excellence in HIV care in the country and the only in Uttar Pradesh, where the facility of second line drugs is available. It monitors the activity of 11 ART centres in Bihar, UP and Madhya Pradesh. It is also a training and research centre.According to the doctor, those patients registered in ART centre of BHU, who have completed six month's therapy and are stable and have increasing CD4 count, can be referred to Link ART centres affiliated to BHU ART centre established in the neighbouring districts of Ballia, Ghazipur, Jaunpur, Mau, Sonebhadra, Bhadohi, Chandauli and Azamgarh. They are basically drug distribution centres. Beside the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) and Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission (PPTCT) centre, Shiv Prasad Gupta District Hospital Kabirchoura, Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Regional Hospital Pandeypur and Central Jail Hospital Sivpur are other centres where free HIV investigation is available under NACO supervision.The crux of the whole exercise is to protect precious human life. The doctor says if by mistake one deviates and acquires this disease, he should not lose courage. He should get investigated and should take proper medicine and advice from the health personnel. An early diagnosis of HIV status helps in preventing and significantly delaying morbid conditions associated with HIV/AIDS. If the HIV-infected person is irregular in time or quantity of the drugs, or he starts and stops the drugs abruptly, the treatment becomes ineffective. The HIV infected person can live a productive and healthy life if he takes care of his health, eating habits and lifestyle.Vital FactsWhat is HIV?Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a virus, which damages the body's immune system by destroying CD4+lymphocutes. This CD4 cells help us to fight against infections. Thus destruction of these cells by the virus leads to immune deficiency and susceptibility to different infections.How it spreadsHIV infection spreads through unsafe sexual contact, transfusion of infected blood or blood products, sharing needles to inject drugs and from mother to child during childbirth and breast-feeding. However, HIV does not spread through mosquito bites, tear, saliva, urine, by embracing, casual kissing, hand shaking, working together, taking bath or swimming together with HIV infected person.In India, it is migrant population, truck drivers, community sex workers and IV drug abusers who are affected. They, in turn, spread the disease to their wives, children and clients.Clinical presentationWithin a few weeks of being infected, some people get fever, headache, sore muscles and joints, stomach ache, swollen lymph glands or a skin rash for one or two weeks. Most people think it is flu. After the initial illness, patients can remain symptom free for many years (3-10 years), as the CD4 cell count decreases and the immunity decreases the patient first gets minor infection then the severity of infection increases. The last stage of HIV infection is when the CD4 decreases below 200 per micro litre is called AIDS when the patient may succumb to minor illness.How to get testedIf any person wants to get himself tested for HIV, he should go to the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) which provides free testing and counselling. The ICTC centres are present in every district hospital and medical colleges. If a person tests positive, he is referred to the nearest anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre.TreatmentOnce a person is infected with HIV virus, the virus can never be eliminated from the body. However, there are drugs available that can suppress the level of virus in the body. These drugs are available free of cost at all ART centres. Every HIV positive patient may not be started on treatment immediately. The treatment is started on the basis of CD4 count and stage of the disease. The treatment, if started, has to be continued lifelong. It is extremely important to adhere to the treatment so as to prevent failure of the drug regimen.Where to go for treatmentThe National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) control programme in India through 35 HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Societies and 269 ART centres throughout the country. The ART centre at Sir Sunder Lal (SSL) hospital of BHU provides free HIV testing, treatment, counselling, nutritional advice and AVR drugs to the registered patients.(Source: Centre of Excellence/ART Centre, BHU)","['hiv', 'patients', 'drugs', 'infected', 'virus', 'centres', 'way', 'bhu', 'art', 'persons', 'major', 'centre', 'treatment', 'helping']","And, Varanasi is supposed to be one of the main centres of HIV infected persons due to its migrant population.

Be that as it may, 2.6 lakh people are still in dire need of ART.According to the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) latest report, “Towards Universal Access”, which tracks progress in achieving the 2010 target for HIV prevention, treatment and care; around 5.8 lakh HIV patients required ART in end-2009.Globally, the HIV epidemic continued to be a real public health challenge as around 33.4 million people are suffering from the lethal disease. In 2008 alone, 2.7 million people were newly infected with the virus.According to the report, only one-third of HIV patients have been put on ART, and coverage of prevention interventions is largely inadequate.This year, WHO’s revised guidelines on ART for adults and adolescents, including would-be mothers, said ART would be initiated when CD4 cell counts reach or drop below 350 cells/mm3, irrespective of whether the patients have clinical symptoms. As per this count, though an estimated 11 -14 lakh HIV patients in India need ART, only 23% are receiving the treatment.The number of pregnant women, who require ART, is pegged at 43,000. But only 21% are covered. Another 30,000-76,000 HIV positive children, too, require ART.However, there has been a spurt in the number of HIV tests across the world. For instance, 100 countries had tested 67 million people last year.In 82 countries — for which comparable data was available for 2008 and 2009 — the median number of tests performed per 1,000 people had increased from 41 to 50, respectively. ART coverage, among young adults less than 15 years, has gone up from 22% in 2008 to 28% in 2009.Even the percentage of HIV positive pregnant women receiving ART to prevent mother-to-child transmission has increased from 45% in 2008 to 53% in 2009. In end-2009, 5.25 million people were receiving ART in low and middle-income countries, including India, which translates to an increase of over 1.2 million people from the previous year.The report maintains that HIV-related TB remains a cause for concern. In 2008, of the 9.4 million TB cases reported worldwide, an estimated 1.4 million were diagnosed among HIV patients.

The period between April to August this year alone saw the number touch the 239 mark. Also, HIV accounts for 30 per cent of the average 100-120 prison deaths each year in the state.More alarming is the fact that these figures are only approximate. For, there is no mandatory HIV screening of prisoners at the time of admission and thus officials admit that they are not aware of HIV status of many inmates in various state prisons. “Some persons consider HIV tests to be taboo and do not give their consent to be screened. Even though they belong to the high risk group, their status remains unknown,” said R V Chandravadan, project director of AP state AIDS control society (APSACS).With rampant instances of men having sex with men (MSM) once they are secluded from mainstream society and confined to their barracks, this figure is a fair indicator of the vulnerability of other prisoners, which is now manifest in the form of diseases.“A large number of them are presently suffering from genital ulcer disease (GUD) which results from having unnatural forms of sex. Once diagnosed with such diseases, they become ten times more susceptible to acquiring AIDS at a later date,” said a medical practitioner who recently visited and interacted with medical officers of two central prisons in the state.With APSACS having introduced its ‘Raksha’ project in state prisons in February last year as part of which prisoners are screened and those carrying the HIV infection sent for treatment, the mechanism is presently in place. But no decision has been taken yet by the prison authorities to keep a check on the HIV positive count once APSACS concludes its intervention programme next year.“Habitual offenders who keep coming back to prison for petty crimes often indulge in unsafe sex outside and have multiple partners thus posing a threat to other inmates,’’ said a prison superintendent.","['hiv', 'positive', 'having', 'prison', 'numbers', 'prisons', 'number', 'sex', 'bars', 'various', 'state', 'prisoners', 'rise']","HYDERABAD: State prisons are turning into HIV hubs with a three-fold rise in the number of fresh HIV cases detected in various prisons this year.Figures collated by a state government body which works closely with HIV positive persons throws up the alarming fact: as against the 119 prisoner from across the state who tested positive for HIV in 2009, the count this year has touched 362 as on date.

A special emphasis during the discussion was on gender norms. The researchers emphasised the need to produce greater gender equality and to shift norms that place aggression, violence and sexual exploitation within the masculine domain and are aggravated under the influence of alcohol.Ongoing research in different countries suggests that women’s risk of gender-based and sexual violence is also increased by their partner’s alcohol consumption. Therefore, without addressing gender issues, efforts to reduce alcohol-related sexual-risk behaviour might only be partly successful.Speaking at the conference, Dr Ravi Verma , regional director, International Center for Research on Women (ICRW), said, “Gender is missing from many alcohol related as well as HIV related interventions. Interventions of any kind in the development sector must be conscientious of gender.

To prevent this transmission, the State Aids Control Society (SACS), Chandigarh, has started providing free milk powder to the HIV-positive mothers until the child is six months. It is expected to benefit around 100 such women. Out of the 1,176 registered positives in the city, 200 are women of reproductive age.SACS director Dr Vanita Gupta says, “Breastfeeding can transmit the virus to a child. We advise continuity of whatever milk a child is on. In case, a positive mother is unable to continue feeding the infant before it turns six months and makes it drink processed one, it develops infection.”“The mothers need not bother about how to sustain the life of their young one as the free supply will continue until the baby turns six months. At the time of anti-retroviral therapy, we screen out expectant mothers who can avail this scheme from their nearest integrated counselling and testing centres,?”she adds.The SACS has roped in a few NGOs to manage finances for the purpose. It is only after a doctor clinically decides the criteria of which patient can breastfeed, the milk tin is given, states Dr Archana Mohan of SACS.HIV can spread from a mother to her infant during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding. When milk powder feed is followed by breastfeed, the lining of the baby’s intestine is destroyed. This makes it susceptible to HIV, warns Dr Vanita.Most of the positives are unable to afford this nutrient. The virus disables them to work and earn livelihood. This small initiative can make some difference for them.

This major policy shift was finalised by NACO on Thursday night.Till now, NACO only provided second line treatment to those HIV patients who were part of its ART centres and had become resistant to first line drugs. Those patients on first line treatment in private hospitals or clinics were not eligible.Second line treatment is tremendously expensive and not affordable for the common man. Also, it was only available in NACO's ART centres. So, patients who did not get first line treatment in NACO's ART centres perished if they became resistant.Solicitor general Gopal Subramaniam informed a Supreme Court Bench comprising Chief Justice S H Kapadia, Justices K S Radhakrishnan and Swatanter Kumar that the health ministry took this decision on Friday. He informed the SC that details of the decision would be intimated through an affidavit in two weeks.So what happens to those who were put on first line ART post-2004 but have become resistant to first line drugs? Expert committees in the 10 centres of excellence presently in charge of giving second line treatment will take a call.ART is the only known treatment that inhibits HIV. The drugs slow down the replication of HIV and immune deterioration is delayed leading to an improvement in the survival and quality of life.While first line drugs cost NACO Rs 5,000 per patient per year, second line cost them Rs 35,000 per patient per year. Patients, however, get the treatment free of charge.India is home to an estimated 2.3 million HIV patients of which 6 lakh would require to be on ART. At present, 3.55 lakh HIV patients are receiving first line treatment in 285 NACO ART centres.Ten centres have rolled out second line ART to 1,701 HIV patients. Five more centres in Nagpur, Pune, Salem, Aurangabad and Surat have been trained to start second line ART while two centres in Vijayawada and Hubli are being prepared.India rolled out second line ART for the first time on December 1, 2008 in Mumbai's J J Hospital and Chennai's Tambaram ART centre.Resistance to first line treatment mainly happens because of poor adherence to the treatment regimen. If not put on second line immediately, most of these patients die within a few years.A CD-4 count test is used to gauge immunity levels of an HIV-infected patient and to assess whether damage caused by the virus requires life-saving ART. The CD-4 count in healthy adults ranges from 500 to 1,500 cells per cubic millimetre of blood. In HIV infected people, it goes down by 60 cells per cubic millimetre of blood per year as HIV progresses. ART is administered when an HIV positive person registers a CD-4 count under 200.","['hiv', 'free', 'patients', 'second', 'drugs', 'naco', 'centres', 'secondline', 'art', 'resistant', 'treatment', 'line']","This major policy shift was finalised by NACO on Thursday night.Till now, NACO only provided second line treatment to those HIV patients who were part of its ART centres and had become resistant to first line drugs.

Of these, 83 children are healthy and free from HIV infection. One baby died due to early infection.Head of the gynaecology department Dr Suneeta Mittal said 61% of these children were delivered through caesarean procedure as it reduces the chances of infection transmission by one-third. The rest were born through normal delivery. ""We screened more than 10,000 pregnant women admitted at AIIMS under `Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission' programme. Of these, 128 women tested positive for the disease. Fifteen percent opted for termination of the pregnancy while others were operated on and given the required drugs,'' Mittal said.Lalit Kumar, a counsellor at AIIMS, said that 75% of the HIV positive mothers treated by the departments were from the cities, including Delhi. ""There were some cases in which the women were found positive for HIV and the male counterpart tested negative. This led to tension in the family and their relationship was on the verge of breaking. But after the birth of the child, the family was happy,'' said Kumar.The treatment included doses of Nevarapin to the mother during delivery, followed by a single dose to the infant within 72 hours of birth. Except for one child who died within hours of birth as he was infected before the mother reached us, all children are safe and have tested negative for HIV, said Dr Mittal.Out of 84 children born, 47 have completed their periodical tests of 18 months and have tested negative for the infection. ""These children can live a healthy life now. We hope good results for other children too,'' said Dr Mittal. She said that breast feeding can also lead to transmission of HIV infection, so most of the mothers have been advised against it.According to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), every year, more than 7 lakh children become HIV-positive via transmission from their parents across the world.

77,2-12-2010,['Malathy Iyer'],https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg,"MUMBAI: In tune with the global trend, the HIV/AIDS epidemic appears to be slowing down in Mumbai as well. For decades the city was infamous for being the HIV capital of India, but figures available with the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society show that for the third consecutive year the HIV incidence is falling.If 5,420 AIDS cases were registered in 2007, there were only 2,942 cases in 2008 and 1,308 cases in 2009. ""So far this year, we have registered 966 cases,"" said MDACS chief Dr S S Kudalkar, adding that the epidemic is clearly on the wane.The city has many reasons to cheer on the HIV/AIDS front. Many of the indicators that are used to assess the epidemic's spread in the general population show a downward trend. The virus is lower than ever before among pregnant women, dipping from 1.24% in 2005 to 0.53% in the first 10 months of 2010. Public health experts say this unsuspecting segment provides the best indicator of the disease's presence in the general population.People who queue up voluntarily to donate blood provide another indicator of HIV's presence in the society: seropositivity has fallen from 1.06% in 2002 to 0.46% in 2009. In the period up to October 2010, only 903 from 2,19,332 donors tested positive for HIV. ""This means only 0.41% were positive,"" said Kudalkar.But the statistic that the MDACS director is most pleased about is the dipping number of deaths among HIV-positive people whose disease progressed to full-blown AIDS. At the height of the AIDS epidemic, say in 2004, the death rate stood at 8.67% among the 3,205 AIDS patients identified that year. This year, the rate has fallen to 3.7%—that is, 36 deaths among 966 patients. ""It is obvious that with better availability of ART ( anti-retro viral therapy ), patients are leading healthier and longer lives than before,"" said Kudalkar.The downward trend in Mumbai is not surprising as the recently released United Nations AIDS organization's figures show. Globally, HIV infection rates have fallen by nearly 20% in the last 10 years to 2.6 million in 2009 from 3.1 million in 1999.

It said such persons were either switched to second line treatment at an early stage or were put directly on second line drugs without undergoing the preliminary treatment, thus making them hard cases.NACO's attempt to broadbase its second line treatment by excluding those who had little hope of surviving for long was, prima facie, unpalatable to a Bench of Chief Justice S H Kapadia and Justices K S Radhakrishnan and Swatanter Kumar, which was hearing a PIL filed by NGO Sankalp Rehabilitation Trust.""We cannot go by this discrimination. Right to life is a constitutional right,"" it said.

With no treatment available for it, prevention is the only way to control AIDS cases. Add to this social stigma, ostracism and multiple legal issues, AIDS gets more complex, specially in countries like India.HIV the etiological agent of AIDS belongs to the Lentivirus subgroup of the family retroviridae. It is a challenging issue across the world. The virus is present in blood, tissue and all body fluid of infected persons. HIV is spread by sexual contact with infected persons (heterosexual or homosexual), by blood and blood products, and from infected mother to babies.About 85% AIDS cases are due to sexual contact 3.80%, 2.05%, 3.34% and 6.46% due to prenatal transmission, blood transfusion, injecting durg users and others respectively.The World AIDS Day is being observed since December 1, 1988, and aims at raising money, increasing awareness, fighting prejudice and improving education. The theme for this year is ""Universal access and human rights"". World AIDS Day reminds people that HIV still exists and a lot still needs to be done.Head, department of forensic medicine, MLN Medical College , Dr US Sinha says, ""In a study conducted by our department in 2009-10 shows that 75% men and 25% women came for HIV tests here. Out of these, 18.6% men and 12% women were found HIV positive. The maximum HIV+ cases were in the age group of 25-34 years.As far as distribution of persons suffering from psychosomatic disorder is concerned, over 94% people express shock, stigmatisation (76%), discrimination (70%), family violence (47%), social violence (31%), family rejection (41%), social rejection (64%), depression (88%), loneliness (76%), fear (100%) and suicidal tendency (58%).Dr Sinha says as the incidence and public awareness of required immunodeficiency syndrome increases, the ethical, legal and regulatory mechanism too are becoming significant.In August 1989, the AIDS Prevention Bill was moved in Parliament. The section 4 of the bill mandates every registered physician to report each case of HIV positive patient to health authorities, but does not provide a confidentially clause.Section 7 of the Bill however, requires health authorities to undertake counselling, health education and specialised treatment.

Yerawada Central Jail in Pune has 120 HIV infected inmates, the highest in the state.""A total 21,404 prisoners in Maharashtra's prisons were screened in the last two years. Of them, 4,472 inmates were from Yerawada Central Jail. Among them, 120 were detected with HIV infection which is the highest in the state,"" said Dilip Deshmukh , additional project director of the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) told TOI on MondayOf the 467 HIV infected prisoners, 87 have been put on antiretroviral treatment as their CD4 count is less than 250, said Deshmukh.CD4 cells are specialised cells that protect the body. HIV attacks these cells and uses them to spread the virus which weakens the immune system.People without HIV infection have about 700 to 1000 CD4 cells in a drop of blood. HIV infected people are considered to have normal CD4 counts if the number is above 500 CD4 cells in on blood drop.Health experts say that prisoners can be HIV infected if they participate in unprotected sex or share infected needles while using illicit drugs.They also maintained that the HIV infection rate among prisoners was lower than the general populace that came for testing to integrated counselling and treatment centres at hospitals.""The prevalence rate comes to 2.18 per cent of the total number of prisoners which is below the 4.7 per cent incidence rate in the general population coming to ICTCs for testing,"" said Deshmukh.""The presence of HIV infected persons and those at high risk in prisons is a critical challenge. Unlike the general population, many prisoners may not be aware if they are infected with HIV. Often, vastly crowded living conditions lead to such behaviour among prisoners,"" said A L Kakrani, professor and head department of medicine D Y Patil Medical College. He is also an ex-member of the technical resource group of the Government of India on ART.""The tedious prison environment, lack of occupation of mind and body and plain boredom lead to accumulated frustration and tension. This environment leads to the high-risk activities such as use of drugs and unprotected sex between men,"" Kakrani said.The history of five HIV infected inmates at Yerawada jail has revealed that they were MSM (men having sex with men), said Sudhakar Ingale, counsellor of the ICTC centre at the jail. ""We are spreading awareness about the risks associated with MSM among the prisoners,"" he said.A recent UNAIDS report says that the HIV epidemic in Asia was concentrated largely among people who inject drugs, sex workers (FSW) and their clients, and MSMs. About 90 per cent of those newly infected with HIV in India were believed to have acquired it during unprotected sex.The ICTC facilitiesThe Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) facilities were started at Yerawada and Amravati jails by the MSACS as a pilot project on October 2, 2008 . The move came following a directive by the Bombay High Court.The ICTC facilities with full-time counsellors and technicians have been started at five more jails including Nashik, Taloja, Kolhapur, Aurangabad and Nagpur. The other jails in the state send the inmates for testing and counselling to government hospitals that have ICTC facilities.""There are no plans to set up full-fledged ICTCs in all the prisons in the state. Earlier, a proposal was sent to the National AIDS Control Society of India (NACO), but they are ready to extend only training if the state government recruits workforce,"" said Deshmukh.An integrated counselling and testing centre is a place where a person is counselled and tested for HIV, on his own free will or as advised by a medical practitioner. The main functions of an ICTC include counselling and testing for HIV, creating awareness on modes of transmission, prevention of HIV/AIDS for promoting behavioural change and reducing vulnerability.","['hiv', 'ictc', 'prisons', 'testing', 'counselling', 'infected', 'yerawada', 'tops', 'cells', '120', 'inmates', 'state', 'prisoners']","Yerawada Central Jail in Pune has 120 HIV infected inmates, the highest in the state.

The officer had allegedly demanded a bribe of Rs 5,000 from the patient to write a prescription for free anti-retroviral drugs. The role of the centre's counsellor is also suspect in the episode. Another inquiry is on against a medical officer who allegedly demanded money to refer a patient for second line HIV/AIDS treatment. There have also been verbal complaints about medical officers demanding bribes to conduct CD4 tests, which are free of cost.Project director of MSACS, Dr Ramesh Devkar, said that urgent steps were being taken to curb corruption at ART centres across the state.

The children, aged between three and 12 years, were denied admission to a prominent school in Gurgaon last year on ‘medical grounds’ and even the government school they have been shifted to is threatening to remove them as they are HIV positive . The NGO looking after them has alleged that the kids are treated poorly at their school and are mocked at by fellow children.“The students call us ‘bimari’. Even the teachers do not help. They often scold us and make us work,” said 12-year-old Amit (name changed), who studies in Class VI at Rajkiya Vidyalaya in Bhondsi, Haryana. Another 11-year-old child, who has no memories of his parents or where he was born, says teachers discriminate against him. “They make us clean the classroom, do gardening work and often scold us. They ask us why we keep taking medicines and beat us up if we protest,” he alleged, adding that he has no illness and is healthy like any other child.According to Sunita Gupta, chairperson of NGO Drone Foundation which looks after these children, the teacher in-charge of the government-run school has warned of action if a medical certificate is not produced at the earliest. “The children feel scared to go to school. I met the principal some days ago and he threatened disciplinary action as the school was not informed about the fact that these children were HIV positive. They are being harassed,” she claimed. Gupta added that the children, who were orphaned, were first registered under the education program for underprivileged children run by DPS Maruti Kunj in March 2009. “Though the school administration was supportive in the beginning, due to pressure from parents of other children and teachers, they asked us to make alternate arrangement for their education in August. One academic year was lost as all other schools had closed admissions by then,” she said.When contacted, principal of DPS Maruti Kunj Rachna Pandit said that the children were never admitted to the school. “Such children need special care. We talked to doctors and experts about their emergency needs and care, and finally decided to drop them as we do not have expertise in dealing with such cases.

Their further attempt to deny employment to them is again not only unwarranted but also contrary to the dictum laid down by various courts and the policy of the Union of India .""The matter relates to two candidates — identified merely as ‘Mr X’ and ‘Mr Y’ — who were sponsored by the employment exchange for driver posts.While Mr Y had passed plus two, Mr X had served in the Army for eight years.In October 2009 and November 2009, they were considered for appointment and sent to panel doctors for the medical fitness certificate. After their blood samples tested HIV positive, the doctors said they were ‘unfit’ for appointment as drivers.Interestingly, the blood test was not conducted in any specialised laboratory; neither was it done with the consent of the candidates. Also, no prior information or pre-test and post-test counselling was provided by the laboratory. Without heeding to requests, the doctors forwarded the ‘report’ to the transport corporations with findings that they were unfit for employment.Responding to the writ petition, the managements contended that the candidates were HIV-positive and hence not of sound health. There was no fundamental right guaranteed in the Constitution for being selected as driver, it was further submitted.Justice Chandru, expressing shock at the ""layman apprehension"" of the authorities, dubbed the incident unfortunate. He said the issue had already been answered by court decisions all over the world, including the Supreme Court of India. Quoting extensively from judgments in the US and South Africa and other courts in India, Justice Chandru pointed out that the guiding principles of India’s national policy on HIV/AIDS was non-discrimination.Noting that a test for CD4 count dropping below 350 cells per microlitre of blood alone could be the scientific basis for turning down candidates, he said, ""This is the standard test adopted by the Indian Army.""

India is now working on rolling out Red Ribbon buses that would reach out to the most backward villagers — targets that the chugging train missed out while passing through 22 states and 152 districts in one year.Speaking exclusively to ToI, Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said though the train was first introduced in India in 2007, it was primarily used for creating awareness against HIV.In 2010, the ministry decided to use the train to test people for HIV. Doctors, posted on the train and at stations, counselled the patients.""The train reached out to eight million people, trained 81,000 and tested 36,000 for HIV. I have asked National Aids Control Organisation (Naco) to identify specific high prevalence districts, where we will send Red Ribbon buses to provide treatment, counselling and talk about safe sex. The buses will have testing and treatment facilities on board,"" Azad said.Naco is close to identifying around 35 high prevalence districts in six states — West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Orissa, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh — where the Red Ribbon buses will be rolled out by April.A bus, a testing and treatment mobile unit with two doctors and four counsellors will be dedicated for three districts. ""Those being targetted are from backward districts, which the train couldn't reach. Our idea is to contain the virus in small pockets and not let it spread,"" the minister added. The targetted districts are known to be hotspots for migrants to urban areas.""The buses and medical unit will teach migrants about safe sex habits and precautions.

India, which has 2.4 million HIV patients, ranks third after South Africa and Nigeria. However, the country's HIV prevalence is still low at 0.31% from 0.36% in 2006.Migrants are believed to be fuelling India's HIV epidemic. This has led Naco to identify 68 main railway stations in districts across 11 states from where migrants usually board long-distance trains for urban areas.Studies on the relation between migration and HIV conducted recently by Naco in three popular migration corridors — Ganjam-Surat, Darbhanga-Delhi and Azamgarh-Mumbai — threw up shocking findings. The highest burden of HIV was found to be among migrants, after the high-risk groups like sex workers and men who have sex with men.According to the 2001 census, 30.1% of the population was considered to have migrated (314 million) — a considerable increase from 27.4% in 1991.","['hiv', 'districts', 'ribbon', 'red', 'sex', 'naco', 'train', 'migrants', 'backward', 'spread', 'buses', 'awareness', 'treatment']","NEW DELHI: Remember the Red Ribbon Express — the eight-coach train that covered 25,000 km spreading awareness about HIV .

A new method, using filter paper, allows high-end polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to be performed equally effectively on small spots of dried blood rather than a whole blood sample with equal amount of sensitivity and specificity.A pilot project using this method has been successfully implemented at seven paediatric referral centres across the country by the National AIDS Control Organisation ( NACO ) in which a total of 9,000 samples of children, including infants, exposed to the HIV infection, were successfully screened under Early infant HIV diagnosis (EID) programme.“The PCR is a high-end test which is used to diagnose babies born to HIV-positive mothers. Traditionally, the test requires a liquid blood sample, which if taken in a rural area and transported to a testing facility, needs to be kept refrigerated. However, the dried blood spots (DBS) method is easy to prepare in a resource-limited setting and can be stored and shipped to testing facilities without refrigeration. The method has been tested successfully at the seven referral centres,” said Sayan Chatterjee, director-general of NACO, on Thursday.The PCR test using DBS method has proven to be as effective as the PCR using liquid blood samples, with good amount of sensitivity and specificity, he added. The city-based National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) and the B J medical college are among the seven referral centres where the samples were tested with the help of this newer diagnosis method in the last one year.“Out of the 9,000 children, 460 were found to be HIV-positive. In order to reconfirm the results, tests were also conducted on the whole blood samples to substantiate the findings,” said B B Rewari, NACO’s national programme officer. If not treated, an HIV-positive child has a 35 per cent chance of dying by his/her first birthday and a 53 per cent chance of dying before the age of two. But if the baby receives prophylactic antibiotics soon after birth and antiretroviral therapy (ART) as soon as it is medically indicated, he/she has a good chance of surviving childhood and living a long, healthy life.“The challenge in resource-limited settings is identifying HIV-positive infants and providing early access to this life-saving medicine,” Rewari said. The National AIDS Control Organisation has now formulated technical and operational guidelines on care of HIV-exposed infants and children below 18 months of age.The 2010 World Health Organisation guidelines recommend that all HIV-positive infants, under two years of age, begin antiretroviral treatment regardless of CD4 count or disease stage. Without antiretroviral treatment, an estimated 50 per cent of the children with HIV will die before the age of two. HIV DNA testing is necessary to make a definitive diagnosis in children below 18 months because of the persistence of maternal antibodies until this age.","['hiv', 'children', 'blood', 'hivpositive', 'pcr', 'samples', 'effective', 'test', 'method', 'diagnosing', 'infants', 'using']","PUNE: Diagnosing HIV in infants and children has taken a giant leap forward.

The move is expected to bring in better quality of living and help avert co-infections among the HIV infected.“The current evidence in HIV management suggests that antiretroviral therapy should be recommended to those with HIV whose CD4 cell counts are below 350 cells/mm3, from the current threshold which is 250,” said Sayan Chatterje, director-general of National AIDS Control Organisation ( NACO ). He was in the city to attend the three-day consultative meeting on ‘Galvanising Evidence for HIV Management’ that started at the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) in Bhosari on Thursday.There is widespread consensus that ART should be initiated when CD4 counts drop below 350, and this recommendation is supported by data from cohort studies and results from randomised control trials (RCT), he added. Standard antiretroviral therapy (ART) consists of the use of at least three anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs to suppress the HIV virus and stop its progress. “Huge reductions have been seen in rates of death and suffering when use is made of a potent anti-retroviral regimen,” Chatterjee said.B B Rewari, NACO’s national programme officer (ART), said, “The guidelines for administering ART which is at present given to HIV infected people with CD4 count less than 250 is all set to be revamped. It will be like the US once the cut-off level to get ART treatment is raised to 350 CD4 count.”An earlier start to antiretroviral treatment boosts the immune system and reduces the risks of HIV-related death and disease. It also lowers the risk of co-infection like tuberculosis, Rewari said. In 2006, WHO recommended that all patients start ART when their CD4 count (a measure of immune system strength) falls to 200 cells/mm3 or lower, at which point they typically show symptoms of disease. Since then, studies and trials have clearly demonstrated that starting ART earlier reduces rates of death and disease.WHO has now recommended that ART be initiated at a higher CD4 threshold of 350 cells/mm3 for all HIV-positive patients, including pregnant women, regardless of symptoms. “There is enough current evidence that suggest that the ART be initiated at a higher CD4 threshold of 350 cells/mm3. The recommendations churned out of this conference will serve to make policy decision in respect of the change in treatment guidelines,” said Nari’s director Ramesh Paranjape.","['hiv', 'cd4', 'antiretroviral', 'higher', 'count', 'cellsmm3', 'threshold', 'recommended', 'begin', '350', 'art', 'national', 'treatment', 'soon']","PUNE: The cut-off level to begin anti-retroviral treatment (ART) for people living with HIV (PLHIV) is set to be raised to 350 CD4 count from the existing 250.

Saturday’s delivery takes JJ’s tally of childbirths by HIV-positive women to 1,004 in the last 10 years.This is not an ordinary achievement for J J staffers as not many hospitals are willing to 0take up HIV-positive pregnancy cases. “Most of the HIV-positive pregnant women who come to us are either denied admission by hospitals or are referred to us,” said Dr Rekha Daver , head of obstetrics and gynaecology department at J J.The incidence of the babies born with HIV-positivity also has been low, claims the hospital. “We cannot say exactly how many babies were born HIV positive, as many mothers do not return to get their babies tested. But our estimation says that of all the HIV-positive deliveries, 5-10% of babies get the mother-to-child transfusion,” said Dr Daver, who is also the head of positive parent to child transfusion (PPTCT).The hospital has achieved the feat with the help of a certain medicine and delivery method. “According to the guidelines, we give nevrapin before the delivery. We prefer doing a normal delivery—one without making any incisions—to avoid mixing of the mother’s blood with the baby’s. Also, we give the mother the choice to breastfeed, even though there’s a slight chance of virus transmission,” added Dr Daver.Maharashtra District AIDS Control Society (MDACS), however, agrees that the load of conducting deliveries of HIV-positive women has largely fallen on public hospitals. “Public hospitals get majority of HIV-positive pregnant women as private hospitals do not want to do these deliveries. While the number of HIV-positive women directly coming to the public hospitals is high, those referred from private hospitals is equally high,” said Dr S S Kudalkar, project director of MDACS.Dr Y S Nandanwar, head of obstetrics and gynecology at Sion Hospital said that they may have assisted in 1,000 positive deliveries too. “We do not have the exact record, but the incidence of conducting an HIV-positive delivery is 1% in our hospital. Since we conduct more than 10,000 normal deliveries in a year, we must be conducting around 100 HIV-positive deliveries,” he said.","['hospital', 'hiv', 'hospitals', 'babies', 'delivery', 'birth', 'hivpositive', 's', '1004th', 'jj', 'women', 'woman', 'j', 'dr', 've', 'deliveries', 'gives']","MUMBAI: An HIV-positive woman gave birth to a girl on Saturday at the state-run J J Hospital.

An antibody is an infection-fighting protein produced by our immune system when it detects harmful substances like viruses and bacteria.Scientists say these antibodies would ultimately reveal the Achilles heel of the virus. Studies have found that antibodies target a stable portion of the virus that does not frequently mutate - a defence mechanism that has till now helped the virus escape earlier developed experimental vaccines.Experts in this Indian lab will now look at new antibodies and how they bind to the virus. This will tell scientists which part of the virus to target with vaccines. The idea is to create artificially synthesized mimics of their targets on HIV, to be used in vaccines to elicit similar actions and teach the immune system how to thwart HIV infection.""With 7,100 people contracting HIV every day, effective tools to prevent infection are indispensable to the fight against HIV and AIDS. A broadly effective AIDS vaccine would be a powerful asset to efforts to arrest the spread of HIV,"" said M K Bhan , secretary of DBT.This collaborative programme will participate in a coordinated, global effort to create replicas of virus targets in the laboratory for use as immunogens, which are the active ingredients of vaccines. The programme will have the task of developing, testing and then implementing strategies to rapidly screen large numbers of immunogens against HIV-1 (dominant strain) and to prioritize them for further evaluation in preclinical studies.""We are very excited about the launch of this collaboration,"" said Seth Berkley , CEO of IAVI.Other institutions participating in this partnership include the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology in New Delhi and the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.Indians, too, are being screened for such effective HIV slaying antibodies. The country has its share of ""late progressors"" or ""elite controllers"" - people infected with HIV who stay healthy for years without requiring life-saving anti-retroviral treatment (ART). About one in 300 people with HIV is an elite controller.Meanwhile, another fascinating community - mainly comprising women - has also got scientists in India excited. Called ""exposed sero negative"" these are women who have, for years, had sex with HIV-positive, condom-refusing husbands, but never got infected. Many have also had babies who are not HIV-positive.Scientists are studying these elite controllers to see whether they carry special genes, which prevent the virus from multiplying in their bodies.

""We not only need to ensure that the community is made part of the mainstream, but also continue and scale our efforts to reach the unreached.""The convention was organised by Pathfinder International which has been implementing the Mukta project to reduce prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV/AIDS among the most at risk populations such as female sex workers (FSW), MSMs and their partners. Now working in five districts of Maharashtra, the project seeks to transition the management and implementation of the HIV programme to CBOs.The convention held at Panhala brought together around 300 community members from six districts of Maharashtra, namely Kolhapur, Latur, Nasik, Beed, Pune and Yavatmal where CBOs have been formed.

To see them grow healthier is my life’s aim,” the samaritan said.Smriti is among very few people in the city who came forward to help the HIV positive children. She is fondly called ‘Maa’ by these kids. Everyday, they ran towards the gate to receive her and she, too, doesn’t forget to bring chocolates for them.Most of the children aged between six and 16 years were found abandoned in various parts of the state.

She died after a prolonged illness in 2010. His father left him alone as he left for work in Gujarat.“Most of them were subjected to discrimination in their respective areas. They were ill-treated by their close relatives after knowing their status,” Smriti said.The SMS Hospital, where they were brought initially for treatment, recommended these children to the care centre, which provided them food, shelter and treatment, apart from their schooling at a nearby institute.“In the school, they never face any problem. They mingle with other kids, play with them and exchange notes,” Smriti said.To make the children feel at home, she stuff the centre with toys, puzzles, pool table, cricket and badminton kits.The house has four rooms with each of them having colourful paintings and drawing by the children.A special study room with computers and general knowledge charts is also there where the children undergo many activities, including exercises, fun games and puzzles to sharpen their mind.On the children’s health, Smriti said, “These kids are prone to seasonal diseases and often require intense medication. Hence, I stocked all kinds of medicines in all corners of house.”Kausal, a volunteer at the foundation, said, “I monitor everyone during meals. These kids require nutritional food to help them grow and fight against diseases.”To make the life of these children exciting, the foundation plans to take them on a trip to Goa. “The kids are now very excited about their flight to Goa. Throughout the day, they make plans on how they will make most of the trip,” Kausal said.Also, volunteers both from India and abroad spend quality time with the children at the home during summer months or their pre-job breaks. “I share happiness and my time with them. It gives me immense pleasure to teach them English,” said Pauline Agache, a language student from Belgium, on her visit to the care home.The foundation generate funds by organising luncheons and dinners for the corporate houses as it does not take direct donations and grants.","['hiv', 'positive', 'children', 'orphans', 'foundation', 'trip', 'kids', 'smriti', 'away', 'abandoned', 'centre', 'care']","JAIPUR: It’s home away from home for the 20 children orphaned by HIV/AIDS .

The high incidence rates of HIV highlight the crucial need for intensified efforts to develop an efficacious vaccine.""The MRKAd5 HIV-1 vaccine was designed to ensure T-cells-mediated immune responses that would provide complete or partial protection from HIV-1 infection or a decrease in viral load after being administered.The study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in five sites in South Africa. The vaccine and placebo were given by intramuscular injections on a 0, 1, 6-month schedule to about 800 subjects.It concluded that ""34 participants in the vaccine group were diagnosed with HIV-1 and 28 in the placebo group. There was no evidence of vaccine efficacy. Vaccine efficacy did not differ by sex, age, herpes status or circumcision.""Now, all eyes are on two discoveries that were made in 2009. First, there were two powerful new antibodies that neutralized all major forms of the virus from the body of an African man. An antibody is an infection-fighting protein produced by our immune system when it detects harmful substances like viruses and bacteria.These two antibodies were also found to target a stable portion of the virus that does not frequently mutate — a defense mechanism that has till now helped the virus escape earlier developed experimental vaccines. Experts are looking at exactly where the antibodies bind to the virus. This will tell them which part of the virus to target with vaccines.Researchers believe they can create an effective vaccine if they are able to get the human body to produce such neutralizing antibodies before exposure to HIV.Scientists are looking at a trial of a Thai HIV vaccine, which in 2009 successfully had cut the risk of HIV infection in humans by 31%. In the largest human trial of an AIDS vaccine — involving more than 16,000 volunteers in Thailand — scientists found that HIV infections were prevented in over a third of the 8,000 volunteers, who received the vaccine.Since HIV was first identified in 1981, 40 millions have been infected with the virus. Annually, an estimated four million new infections occur, of which 90% are in developing countries. AIDS has claimed more than 25 million lives over the past 25 years.A vaccine will be a boon for India, where 1.2 lakh new people got infected with the virus in 2009. India, saddled with with 2.4 million HIV patients, ranks third after South Africa and Nigeria as far as HIV burden is concerned.","['fails', 'hiv', '2009', 'vaccine', 'hiv1', 'virus', 'efficacy', 'trial', 'mrkad5', 'million', 'antibodies', 'infection']","NEW DELHI: The hunt for an effective vaccine against the lethal HIV remains elusive.In a phase-II double-blind, randomized test-of-concept study, another promising vaccine candidate — MRKAd5 HIV-1 — has failed to protect the subjects.Announced in the Lancet on Thursday, the paper says ""the MRKAd5 HIV-1 vaccine did not prevent HIV-1 infection or lower viral-load.

Once the amount was transferred by the caller, Singh would withdraw it using ATM cards and the women would stop taking the calls.For masseur training centres, they only entertained male callers.“They would be told that they would not only teach them how to become a masseur, but also provide a list of clients.

The extract of the leaf is added to a solution of silver nitrate and within minutes the entire solution turns into silver nanoparticles. Since, the method used for synthesis of these nanoparticles does not use any added chemicals, it is a cost effective and environmental friendly method.”Congress grass was introduced in India in 1956. It causes contact dermatitis in livestock and is reported to be poisonous to sheep. Humans too are affected by this weed with respiratory malfunction and dermatitis.He said the congress grass would make the farmers reap huge profits as the cost of synthesising one litre of silver nanoparticle is around just Rs 30 whereas the end product can fetch upto Rs 3.5 lakh in the international market.About the methodology, Vyom explained that leaves of congress grass were thoroughly washed thrice in distilled water for 15 min, dried, cut into fine pieces and were boiled with 100 ml of sterile distilled water up to 5 min and were filtered.A team of scientist from various universities of US, including the department of chemical engineering, University of Texas, have reported that silver nanoparticles interact with HIV-1 virus which inhibit the virus from binding to its host cells.Parthenium is responsible for the largest number of skin inflammation cases caused by contact with the plants surface, said Vyom. “I experimented with carrot grass as the pollen grains cause diseases like eczema, asthma and dermatitis.” he added.","['silver', 'hiv', 'grass', 'solution', 'virus', 'congress', 'weed', 'added', 'help', 'fight', 'water', 'nanoparticles', 'vyom']","The extract of the leaf is added to a solution of silver nitrate and within minutes the entire solution turns into silver nanoparticles.

These prisoners are getting free treatment from jail authorities under the de-addition programme called OST (Opioid Substitution Treatment).Jail sources said that prisoners did not know about their HIV status earlier and when they came to know about such programme in Tihar, they joined the centre. Officials say six to eight percent population of Tihar is HIV positive, but it is a fluctuating figure. “Presently, there are 11,800 prisoners in Tihar and this number keeps on fluctuating.

According to the report, at least 4,20,000 children were receiving antiretroviral therapy at the end of 2010, a more than 50 per cent increase since 2008.""Access to treatment will transform the AIDS response in the next decade. We must invest in accelerating access and finding new treatment options,"" said Michel Sidibe, UNAIDS executive director.The report found that in the third decade of the epidemic, people were starting to adopt safer sexual behaviours, reflecting the impact of HIV prevention and awareness efforts. However, there are still important gaps.Young men are more likely to be informed about HIV prevention than young women. Recent demographic health surveys found that an estimated 74 per cent of young men know that condoms are effective in preventing HIV infection, compared to just 49 per cent of young women.In recent years, there has been significant progress in preventing new HIV infections among children as increasing numbers of pregnant women living with HIV have gained access to antiretroviral prophylaxis during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding. The number of children newly infected with HIV in 2009 was 26 per cent lower than in 2001.About 115 low and middle-income countries are providing optimal treatment regimens for pregnant women living with HIV as recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO).The report, however, said despite expanded access to antiretroviral therapy, a major treatment gap remains.At the end of 2010, nine million people who were eligible for treatment did not have access. Treatment access for children is lower than for adults.While the rate of new HIV infections has declined globally, the total number of HIV infections remains high, at about 7000 per day. The global reduction in the rate of new HIV infections hides regional variations.According to the report, above-average declines in new HIV infections were recorded in sub-Saharan Africa and in South-East Asia, while Latin America and the Caribbean experienced more modest reductions of less than 25 per cent.There has been an increase in rate of new HIV infections in Eastern Europe and in the Middle East and North Africa.According to the report, gender inequalities remain a major barrier to effective HIV responses.

Some 30 HIV affected students , including 13 girls, studying between class 3 and 8 in Chitamur Panchayat Union Middle School have been forced to stay away from the school since September 2010.The students had been going to the school in Perunkaranai since 2008, but their HIV status was largely unknown except to the school principal and the village panchayat president. “Some parents came to know about the children’s status through some teachers who were coming from the city last year, and raised the issue at the PTA meetings. They felt uneasy in sending their wards where some children are infected with HIV,” said K Panchanathan, head master, Chitamur Panchayat Union Middle School.The students are under the care of an NGO Arias Home of Hope. Before admitting them to the school in 2008, Arias Home had told the principal of the school about the children being HIV positive. The panchayat president also knew. The principal and the president had thought it better to not discuss the children’s health situation with others. But word got around.Rumours started spreading about HIV in the village. Some came to believe that the infection could spread through water, sharing food and urinals. “Many villagers did not want these children sharing space with other normal students. We were unable to convince them,” P S Elappan, president, Perunkkaranai village, one of the 42 villages in Chitamur Panchayat Union, in Kancheepuram, told The Times Of India.The children are undergoing free Anti Retro Viral Therapy (ART) at the Government Hospital of Thoracic Medicine (GHTM) in Tambaram Sanatorium. The NGO activists are taking classes for these students on their own under the Sarva Sisyan Abhiyan’s (SSA) Education For All scheme, which aims to provide education mainly for school dropouts.The NGO cites distance between the school and the home as a reason to withdraw the students from the panchayan union school. “Distance between the school and our home is around two kms and our children had to miss ART on many occasions as they found it difficult to come home during lunch and get ART and return to school again. I can’t say anything more as the issue is in the court,” Pannerselvam, program manager, Arias Home of Hope, told TOI.On May 30 this year, the Madras high court ordered notice to the school on a public interest litigation relating to this issue. The court also ordered notice to health and educational departments on the PIL filed by K Radhakrishnan of Chengalpet. The petitioner Radhakrishnan, who himself is an HIV-affected person, said that the children had the right to have free and compulsory education and refusal of education to them was a violation of fundamental right.","['hiv', 'village', 'school', 'children', 'forces', 'union', 'education', 'panchayat', 'stigma', 'president', 'students', 'told']","PERUNKARANAI (CHEYYUR): Children affected by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) have been stigmatised in Perunkaranai, near Melmaruvathur — a little over 130 km south of Chennai.

This was recently established by a study of 12 HIV infected men whose blood and semen samples were analyzed by Parel's National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health (NIRRH).The finding is significant, said scientists of NIRRH, as it negates the notion that an infected person can go slow on treatment or think of starting a family once the viral load in the bloodstream becomes undetectable.The study clearly established that the type and behaviour of the HIV virus present in the bloodstream of an infected individual could be drastically different from the type and behaviour of the virus present in the same individual's semen. In certain cases, it could look as if the individual is infected with two different types of virus altogether. The study, carried out by NIRRH in collaboration with the JJ Hospital 's medicine department, was recently published in the Journal of Medical Virology.Principal investigator Dr AH Bandivadekar told TOI that the study proves that the virus could disappear from the blood stream due to anti-retroviral therapy but still be very much present in thesemen. “This difference in the virus nature influences the transmission of HIV, the progression of the ailment, the virus' response to the host defence and also treatment,” he added.Further, Bandivadekar added that the study pointed out that sperm-associated virus too is a huge risk factor for HIV transmission and possibly for parent child transmission. “Therefore, assisted reproductive technology where sperm washing is used may not be termed as a completely safe procedure for maternal or fetal transmission of HIV,” he said.The study further adds to the intriguing nature of the virus as it adds to the unpredictability, given its nature of constant mutation. In several of the individuals studied, the viral count in the blood differed vastly from the count in semen. For instance, while the blood plasma in one individual had 11,284 copies of the virus, the viral presence in his semen was around 5,432 copies. Also, at least in two individuals, the virus load in the blood had gone belowdetectable levels, but there were significant quantities of the virus present in the semen. Simply put, the virus in the blood and semen infected the same individual in different ways.Head of JJ Hospital's ART centre and one of the investigators, Dr Alaka Deshpande, said the study also means that those on anti-retroviral medication should not think that it could keep the virus in both the compartments, blood and semen, under control.“It is now clear that there could be genetic differences in virus even if they are present in the same individual's body,” she added. “It only means that whenever a vaccine or drug is created, the variant nature of the virus has to be kept in mind so that it can attack all compartments,” she added.","['hiv', 'study', 'blood', 'virus', 'infected', 'transmission', 'nature', 'semen', 'exist', 'present', 'individual']","MUMBAI: The clever HIV virus could be present in drastically different variants in the bodily fluids — blood and semen — of the same individual.

However, there are major challenges in reaching out to all pregnant women for ensuring institutional deliveries for all the 27 million pregnancies that happen annually,"" he said.He added, ""To meet this challenge, on June 1, 2011, a new initiative called Janani-Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK) was launched to promote institutional deliveries. Over and above the cash incentives paid for institutional deliveries at government health facilities, this scheme includes free hospitalization, free medicines, free consumables, free diagnostics, free diet (up-to three days in the case of normal delivery and seven days in the case of Caesarean section), free provision of blood and free transport to & fro from home to all pregnant women and their new born.""The minister exuded confidence that the scheme would encourage women to volunteer for HIV testing.","['nregs', 'hiv', 'free', 'patients', 'facility', 'institutional', 'extended', 'women', 'employment', 'wants', 'ensure', 'national', 'stigma', 'minister']","No child should be denied admission in schools and colleges because he or she is afflicted with HIV or because his or her parents are afflicted with this disease.

A doctor, a nurse and an outreach worker will be stationed in each of these centres.The OST centres will also counsel the users to reduce intake of drugs so they can quit gradually.

SALEM: About 750 HIV patients requiring advanced treatment in the state are forced to go without life-saving second-line anti-retroviral therapy (ART) drugs which are in short supply.Hospitals, which are supposed to hand them out free, say they don’t have adequate stocks of these medicines. Officials of the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO), the country’s nodal agency for prevention and control of HIV/AIDS, said the sudden increase in the number of patients receiving second-line of treatment has caused the countrywide shortage of these drugs. Healthcare experts and NGOs fear this would increase the number of patients dropping out of the drug regimen, causing more cases of drug resistance ART is a combination of highly advanced drugs meant to fight HIV infection and increase life expectancy of HIV-AIDS patients. If the first-line of treatment is not adequate to bring down the viral load, patients are given the second-line of drugs. Both these regimens are provided free of cost by NACO.In Tamil Nadu, only two ART centres provide second line of drugs. They are located in Tambaram in Chennai and in Salem city. At least 150 patients from Salem, Krishnagiri, Erode, Namakkal, Karur, Ooty and Coimbatore visit the Salem centre to collect a month’s dosage.For the past one month, patients have been asked to take higher dosage of pediatric drugs or purchase them from the retail market. Second-line ART regimen consists of tenofovir, lamivudin, atazanavir and ritonovir. But ART centre managers say that the NACO has not supplied them with ritonovir. Krishnagiri-based G Karunanidhi, member of Tamilnadu Networking People with HIV/AIDS, is among those prescribed the second line ART medicine. He visits the ART centre every month to collect his monthly quota of drugs.On July 18, the centre gave him medicines for only four days though his usual dosage is for a month. “They asked me to come back to Salem after four days to collect the remaining drugs. I went back on July 25 and I was told they had not received the stock,” he said. P Nagaraj of Salem Network of PLWHA wasn’t as lucky. He was asked to take the pediatric ART drugs. “They told me that I could take double the child’s dose.I avoided it as I feared side effects,” he said. Experts say the drugs may not produce the desired effect unless they are taken at the right time and dosage. Dr Sentha Krishnan, who is in charge of Salem ART centre, said there were no stocks of ritonovir tablets. “We have not received supply of the drugs from NACO since mid-July. We ask patients to take a combination of lopinavir-ritonovir tablets. It has no side effects.NACO has told us the stocks will be replenished in a few days,” she said. NACO's regional co-ordinator SThennarasu said the situation was the same all over the country. NACO's national programme officer (ART) BB Rewari confirmed that the number of persons taking second line ART has increased. “We have added five more centres to give the second line of ART drugs. We are doing our best to give everyone the medicines. Instead of buying from international companies, we are now planning to go in for local pharmaceutical companies,” he said.","['hiv', 'treatment', 'dosage', 'patients', 'drugs', 'second', 'denied', 'secondline', 'art', 'centre', 'salem', 'low', 'stock', 'line']","If the first-line of treatment is not adequate to bring down the viral load, patients are given the second-line of drugs.

But the city is rolling out a new plan for prevention – known as New Directions – which primarily funds organizations working with Caucasian, African American and Latino gay men, according to API community advocates.""Trikone is saddened by the San Francisco Public Health Department's decision to slash funding for HIV/AIDS programs affecting the API community,"" Harsha Mallajosyula, advocacy director for Trikone – an organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people – said.""Surveys have consistently shown that the API community is one of the most vulnerable communities to new HIV infections and these budget cuts will only curtail the testing and awareness efforts taking place in earnest,"" he added.""Allocating resources should correlate with consistent data that places API community in high risk category and not on how visible our community is.

""In the New Directions program, women are completely excluded,"" stated Sheth, noting that API women tend to get tested at very late stages, when they already have AIDS.""As a community, we are very family-oriented, and the stigma of having AIDS is so deep, we wouldn't want to dishonor our family by saying we have it,"" said Sheth, explaining why more APIs do not get tested for the virus.The Indian American community needs ""culturally competent"" organizations to provide HIV prevention services.But Grant Colfax, director of the HIV Prevention and Research Section in the San Francisco Department of Public Health AIDS Office, said the City would ensure that APIs received HIV prevention. ""They have not been cut out of the budget,"" he told India-West.The New Directions program has allocated funds proportionately within ethnicities, dedicating the biggest allotment to high-risk groups, said Colfax.According to data from the SFDPH, Caucasian, African American and Latino gay males are at the highest risk for acquiring new HIV infections, along with transgendered men and intravenous drug users. Asian Americans represented 11 percent of all new HIV infections in 2010, and 8.7 percent of people living with AIDS.Colfax said his budget was based on AIDS data for 2010, and added that 8.7 percent of funding – roughly $844,000 – would be allocated to organizations working on HIV prevention in the API community.Asked to name such organizations, Colfax pointed to Magnet, an organization for gay men which offers free sexual health services, including HIV testing. Magnet, however, has no APIs on its staff or advisory board and its Web site featured no Asian American men.There is no evidence of an increase in HIV infections among Asian American women in San Francisco, stated Colfax, adding that the SFDPH is working to make HIV testing a routine part of health care screenings.In an Aug. 1 meeting with several lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender organizations, Colfax acknowledged that APIs were a ""gap population"" and promised to look at additional options for HIV prevention for Asian Americans.Source: India-WestBy SUNITA SOHRABJI- India-West Staff Reporter","['american', 'hiv', 'community', 'budget', 'san', 'women', 'api', 'slashes', 'asian', 'organizations', 'francisco', 'americans', 'prevention']","""Trikone is saddened by the San Francisco Public Health Department's decision to slash funding for HIV/AIDS programs affecting the API community,"" Harsha Mallajosyula, advocacy director for Trikone – an organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people – said.

These HIV neutralizing antibodies are produced naturally by a minority infected with HIV, but who show no symptoms.The new antibodies that target the CD4 binding site on HIV — the site where the virus engages the T cells to initiate its infection — was isolated from blood serum samples across the world.Dr Rajat Goyal, IAVI's India head said, ""This cocktail of bNAbs will help us design the most effective immunogens, the active ingredients of vaccines, which will then help us find the elusive HIV vaccine. Only a minority, who are HIV-positive, begin to produce bNAbs after several years of infection. Animal studies suggest that such antibodies could block HIV infection if they were elicited by a preventive vaccine.""The 17 new bNAbs were isolated from four HIV-positive individuals that are mostly of African descent. Earlier in 2009, this same research team had found two potent bNAbs, PG9 and PG16.Dennis Burton, director of the IAVI Neutralizing Antibody Center , said, ""Most antiviral vaccines depend on stimulating the antibody response to work effectively. Because of HIV's remarkable variability, an effective HIV vaccine will probably have to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies. This is why we expect that these new antibodies will prove to be valuable assets in the field of AIDS vaccine research.""Experts say a vaccine against HIV is a must with 7,000 new HIV infections occurring daily and 9 million HIV-infected individuals unable to access life-saving antiretroviral medication.The new bNAbs are encouraging. Many of them bind to unknown molecular structures on the surface of HIV. This means that they could significantly broaden the target options researchers have in designing vaccines to elicit similar antibodies.Since HIV was first identified in 1981, 40 millions have been infected with the virus. Annually, an estimated four million new infections occur, of which 90% are in developing countries. Over the last 25 years, AIDS has claimed more than 25 million lives.It is widely believed that to prevent HIV infection, an AIDS vaccine would need to teach the body to produce these powerful antibodies before exposure to the virus.","['hiv', 'aids', 'vaccine', 'virus', 'bnabs', 'scientists', 'closer', 'million', 'isolate', 'antibodies', 'neutralizing', 'infection', 'vaccines']","Animal studies suggest that such antibodies could block HIV infection if they were elicited by a preventive vaccine.

As per the rule, 25% of the students in a private un-aided school should be from this category. This will help avoid discrimination. However, it is not implemented.""

NGOs made several recommendations based on their experience in working with HIV positive children.

Hence, special teaching practices for them must be undertaken by schools.""

A representative of the Rashtrasant Tukdoji Maharaj Arogya Prasarak Mandal in Amravati, said, ""The quantity of mid-day meal for HIV students must be doubled and it should be more nutritious. Besides, pure drinking water and clean toilet must be provided to save them from infections.""

The participants also suggested that a district-level forum must be formed to address complaints from schools if there is a case of discrimination.

The love and care continues to come their way, but the support has been withdrawn as these volunteers can no longer afford to provide it.

Since the last five months, the National AIDS Control Organisation has not been providing funds to many social outfits that provide counseling along with medical and other facilities to HIV positive people. This has forced a few of them to shut their operations completely. City-based NGO Nagpur Multipurpose Social Service Society, along with the two community care centers (CCCs), that catered to People Living with HIV (PLHs) and their children, have closed their operations.

""We have around 1380 children registered with us, some of them are themselves affected by HIV and some have parents suffering from AIDS. We tried to provide them emotional, educational and every kind of support. During the last five years of association with them, only 13 children died. The life span of the suffering kids has increased under our guidance as they got the required medication and nutrition,"" informed Sr. Daya Matthews, SMMI, the project director of project Chah.

NACO had conducted inspection of all the organizations that were receiving funds from them in February this year wherein all centres had got a favourable report. In fact, the centre at Mure Memorial Hospital had been upgraded from 'C' to 'A' category. Despite this, the funds were discontinued from the next financial year beginning in April.

After a couple of months, the representatives from CCCs from across the states of Maharashtra and Karnataka were running from pillar to post, trying to gather why this had happened. ""We have been trying to contact the authorities from NACO, who have remained non-communicative. We even visited their Delhi office but in vain,"" revealed Datta Patil, executive director of Youth for Unity & Voluntary Action (YUVA) that runs one such centre in Beed.

However, Dr Bhalchandra Kinikar of Niramaya Arogya Dham, Solapur, said that they have received some reassurance from Karnataka Health Promotion Trust (KHPT), the organization that distributes the funds to the NGOs in the two states, that the files have moved up and the money may come in soon.

Under this project, many of the children who had left their education midway were reinducted, while many others were provided with employment opportunities. They were also informed about the various government schemes they could benefit from. The organization, however, has had to discontinue all its activities due to lack of funds. ""We could not keep our staff, many of whom were PLHs, as there were no means of sustaining them,"" said Sr Daya.

The condition of the CCCs is no different. Amrita Joshi, who runs the centre at Rameshwari recounts the measures she had to resort to for cost cutting. ""We had to do away with some of our staff. We now have no janitor, cook or nurse. The guidelines given by NACO regarding the number of people we can employ is already insufficient. If more people are required the NGO itself has to arrange for their salaries,"" she said.

The Mure Memorial Hospital CCC which used to get a footfall of over a hundred patients every month, now, only sees a few people coming in. ""We too had to relieve one of our nurses. The actual need is of three nurses but we have two, with one being provided by the hospital whenever there is a need. Even now, the nurse on night duty is not our employee but that of the hospital,"" said Ashish Sontakke, the accountant of the centre.","['hospital', 'hiv', 'left', 'aids', 'body', 'children', 'kids', 'dry', 'funds', 'support', 've', 'provide', 'centre', 'cccs', 'project', 'care']","NAGPUR: Several city children, whose lives were marred by a black mark called AIDS, used to get love, care and support from some loving 'sisters'.

KOLKATA: She was born a thalassaemia major, contracted HIV through blood transfusion that kept her alive and was thrown out of Bankura Sammilani Medical College which refused to treat her in 2010. Ramtanu Ghoshal didn't know whom to turn to with his 10-year-old daughter Manasi (name changed) till he travelled to Kolkata and sought help from doctors at the Aids unit of Calcutta Medical College Hospital last November. By then, the youngster's spleen had got enlarged and her blood cells were fast disintegrating. Treatment at the hospital and a surgery at a city cancer institute has given little Manasi a fresh lease of life. But it could be a temporary reprieve, according to doctors.

""She was diagnosed as a thalassaemia patient when she was just 11 months old. Ever since, Manasi has been on transfusion. But it was two years ago that we were left devastated by a blood test that revealed she was HIV-positive. She contracted the virus during one of the numerous transfusions that she had gone through at the Bankura Medical College. Even though they were responsible, the hospital refused to carry on treatment and forced us to seek help in Kolkata,"" said Ramtanu, a farmer from Bankura.

After a six-month stint at Calcutta Medical College last year, Manasi was moved to the Netaji Subhas Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) in March, 2011. She was then staring at death. Manasi had hypersplenism (enlarged spleen) - a result of repeated blood transfusions that had led to iron deposits in her system. Her blood cells and platelets were breaking up, leading to a sharp fall in RBC and WBC counts. Manasi's haemoglobin count, too, had plummeted and she needed a transfusion every week.

Only a spleenectomy or a spleen replacement surgery could revive her. ""It's always risky to operate an HIV patient. Manasi had thalassaemia as well and was extremely frail when she same to us. But what made us worry was the fall in her blood cell count that had virtually reduced her immunity to zero. Being HIV-positive, she was in danger of succumbing to the virus unless the blood cell counts were normalised immediately,"" said Ashish Mulhopadhyay, director, NCRI.

On September 3, a team of surgeons comprising Supriyo Ghatak, Sumit Gulati, Niladri Bhattacharya, Ranjan Bhandari and Jhumka Datta, conducted a spleenectomy on Manasi. The surgery has ressurected the girl. Her red blood cell, white blood cell and platelet counts have already shown a marked improvement. She will now need a blood transfusion only once every three months. ""More importantly, her immunity has improved, which will act as a shield against HIV. But this is a temporary reprieve and Manasi must remain under treatment for the rest of her life,"" said Supriyo Ghatak, a visiting surgeon at NCRI.","['hiv', 'manasi', 'transfusion', 'medical', 'blood', 'second', 'thalassaemia', 'chance', 'cell', 'treatment', 'girl', 'college', 'surgery', 'gives']","She contracted the virus during one of the numerous transfusions that she had gone through at the Bankura Medical College.

Little hearts, but sunk by an overwhelming thought that death may strike early. They live in the shadows and prefer anonymity for fear of discrimination. And those who go to school are often ostracized. Nor do they get specialized treatment despite massive funds being pumped for HIV care. What’s shocking is that their numbers are in thousands in Delhi. The city has at least 11,333 children infected with HIV. Most of them, nearly 2000, are concentrated in south Delhi and around 1,700 in the New Delhi area. Others are scattered across the city.The plight of these children has been highlighted in a study commissioned by the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR). The report states that the nine anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centres are not wellequipped and HIV-infected kids are yet to receive benefits of any government scheme. DCPCR has now sent its recommendations to the Delhi government for rehabilitation of these children. A potent anti-retroviral regimen helps suppress the HIV virus and preserves normal immune response in children.The study was carried out by ARADHYA (Action for Resource Development in Health-Education by Youth Association) over a period of four months — starting March this year. The objective was to map children infected by HIV. Volunteers collected data from the Delhi State AIDS Control Society, ART centres, integrated counseling centres, blood banks, private doctors, counsellors and related agencies to find out the number of HIV patients in the city.

The case will be heard by Chief Justice J Chelameswar and Justice PR Ramachandra Menon on Wednesday.

Foundation for Integrated Research in Mental Health, a voluntary health organization based at Thiruvananthapuram, has taken up the case of an HIV positive patient who was denied treatment by a private hospital at Thiruvananthapuram and is moving a petition before the high court challenging the stances taken by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and Kerala State Aids Control Society (KSACS) towards the treatment denial.

Ashok Nair, who is HIV positive, was denied treatment when he was taken to Cosmopolitan hospital at Thiruvananthapuram after he suffered multiple fractures in a traffic accident. He was advised of the need for urgent surgery as he had suffered multiple fractures and was taken to the trauma care wing of the hospital. Ashok told the hospital staff that he was HIV positive. Upon learning that he was HIV positive, the hospital authorities denied to provide treatment to him and referred him to the Medical College Hospital of Thiruvananthapuram.

Ashok approached the human rights commission questioning the hospital's denial of treatment. KSACS enquired into the incident and submitted a report that accepted the hospital's stance that the patient was sent back as he was in need of surgery for which the hospital didn't have facilities. When the petition by Ashok was considered by NHRC, it accepted KSACS' report and dismissed allegations of treatment denial.The petitioner alleges that the explanation by the hospital is not credible as their website boasts of a specialty clinic for orthopaedic and trauma care.","['hospital', 'hiv', 'positive', 'court', 'taken', 'human', 'denied', 'petition', 'moves', 'thiruvananthapuram', 'patient', 'ksacs', 'treatment']","KOCHI: Patients infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) are being denied treatment by hospitals in the State, points out a petition before the Kerala High Court.

While growing need for spreading awareness among high risk groups like commercial sex workers and migrant populations was highlighted during the one-day visit of director general (DG) of NACO, Aradhana Jauhari, to various ART centres in the city on Tuesday, the changing dynamics of HV/AIDS in east UP and Bihar regions of the country also attracted attention on the occasion.

""Awareness holds the key for curbing the menace of HIV in eastern UP region and parts of Bihar that have now become the high priority areas for National AIDS Control Organisation NACO,"" said Jauhari while talking to TOI after visiting the ART centre at Banaras Hindu University (BHU) on Tuesday.

Saying that the invisible killer has continued to spread its tentacles in the Hindi speaking states like UP, Bihar, MP and Rajasthan, she stressed that the selected pockets of east UP and Bihar with high migrant population remain high risk zones in the country.

Apart from Varanasi, Jaunpur and Ghazipur, other pockets like Azamgarh-Bhiwandi-Mau and Patna-Muzaffarpur in Bihar have a good number of migrating people who are infecting their family members and local population with the HIV virus.

There is an urgent need to spread awareness among the high risk groups of migrant population and devise a strategy to effectively address the issue, she said.

It may be mentioned here that the DG of NACO visited ART centres of BHU, SPG Divisional Hospital and DDU Hospital besides holding a meeting of UP NACO officials and other senior district health officials in the day.

Stressing the fact that prevention is the only cure in this case, the DG said that eastern UP and Bihar states could learn from the experiences of Tamil Nadu and other southern states that have shown reversal in the trend with receding cases in the last few years.

Similarly, advocating for establishment of more ART centres in east UP and Bihar, she also maintained that counselling, support and care services offered through ART centres including integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC) and voluntary counselling and testing centres (VCTC) need to play pro-active role in spreading awareness.

The overall prevalence rate of HIV infection has reduced to 50% in the last one decade, but still the figure is high particularly in the Hindi speaking states. A prevalence rate of 0.3% is far from satisfactory and much work is yet to be done to bring it further down, she added.","['hivaids', 'bihar', 'hiv', 'reduce', 'states', 'naco', 'centres', 'population', 'high', 'risk', 'art', 'need', 'cases', 'awareness']","There is an urgent need to spread awareness among the high risk groups of migrant population and devise a strategy to effectively address the issue, she said.

""I received a tip that one person in Ichalkaranji is selling the kits to private laboratories. After checking the information from other sources, we laid a trap. Some of our officials were sent to Ichalkaranji. They approached the person and expressed willingness to purchase the kit. The person, in turn, called up another man who would procure the kits for sale. The man came there and asked for Rs 5,000 for 100 kits. The officials negotiated and purchased 100 kits for Rs 4,000.

""We have dismissed the counsellor from service from September 20. A complaint has been registered with the police,"" Deshmukh added.

An ICTC is a place where a person is counselled and tested for HIV, on his own free will or as advised by a medical provider. There are now more than 4,000 counselling and testing centres in India, mainly at government hospitals. In Maharashtra, there are 578 ICTCs where testing and counselling is provided free.

A corrupt counseller was arrested last week and both he and a lab technician, also involved in the alleged racket, have been dismissed from their job.

The incident came to light when Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS) officials in Mumbai were informed that outreach workers of an NGO in Kolhapur were trying to sell HIV testing kits. The rapid testing kits, which can reveal an individual's HIV status in less than 30 minutes, is provided to the MSACS by the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) for free. The MSACS later distributes the kits to its 578 integrated centre for counselling and testing (ICTC) centres across the state.

On getting the information, the MSACS officials decided to nab the culprits. Once the investigation started, the officials found that one of their own counsellors, Raghunath Kamble, and lab technician Hemlata Patil were the masterminds and the NGO workers were mere mediators.

Additional project director Dr Dilip Deshmukh, who helped nab the culprits with the help of MSACS officials from Kolhapur, told TOI that the incident was shocking and something that the agency had never witnessed. ""The culprit has been handed over to the police and a case has been registered. We are now checking if such a racket exists in other parts of the state,"" he said.

District superviser of Kolhapur Niranjan Deshpande was the first one to learn about the racket. Subsequently, on finding that Naagsen Kamble, an outreach worker from Lotus Medical Foundation, was trying to sell the testing kits to private labs, Deshmukh sent some officials as decoy customers.

These officials contacted Naagsen, who on September 19 called them to say the deal would be sealed in a hotel at Jaysinghpur, a small town in Kolhapur. ""As our officials, posing as customers, reached the hotel, they found that it was one of our counsellors, Raghunath, who was trying to sell the kits,"" said Deshmukh, adding that he offered Rs 5,000 for two kits, which can conduct up to 100 tests. Deshmukh then contacted the police who arrested Raghunath.

During his interrogation, the counsellor told the police that lab technician Hemlata also had some testing kits at her home. ""Hemlata's house was searched and around 30 kits were recovered from her refrigerator,"" added Deshmukh. He said both Raghunath and Hemlata had been dismissed from MSACS.

The HIV/AIDS positive rate in the state, however, is at an all time low, even as the number of people testing for HIV/AIDS is the highest ever.

Between 1986 and 2011, over three lakh persons have undergone the test to check for their HIV status in Goa. Of these, 13,913 individuals have tested HIV positive and 1,453 have resulted in AIDS cases to date. The number of male AIDS patients in Goa, between 1986 and 2011, has been more than double at 1,009 of the 444 females detected with the ailment.

The highest number of HIV positive cases were reported in Goa in 2007. The number of cases came down to 1,019 in the following year and to 959 in 2009. Last year, the HIV positive cases came further down to 821 and to 459 this year till August. The positivity rate has also come down from 13.41% in the late '90s to 4.77% in 2007 and just 1.86% in 2011 so far.

The number of persons testing for HIV, however, has grown exponentially from just 2,279 in 1995 to as much as 18,380 by 2006. The number went up further to 26,737 in 2008 and touched an all time high in the following year to 33,473. In the present year, already 24,691 persons have tested for HIV up to August. This increase in numbers can be attributed to increased awareness of the ailment brought about through state and central government efforts.

Over the years, the Goa State Aids Control Society (GSACS) has set up Integrated Counseling and Testing Centers (ICTCs) in three private hospitals in addition to 14 ICTCs operational in government hospitals.

An ICTC is where a person goes for counseling and testing for HIV. The person comes entirely of his/her own will or as advised by a medical practitioner. The ICTCs provide HIV testing with pre-test and post-test counseling, drugs for opportunistic infections, free distribution of condoms and follow-up counseling for HIV positive cases through field visits. The centres also provide testing, pre-test and post-test counseling to pregnant mothers who come for ante-natal check ups.

On Saturday, two HIV positive women narrated their sordid tales in a media workshop organized by the Rajasthan Network for People Living With HIV/AIDS (RNP+) in Jaipur.

They said that the attitude of their inlaws changed when they came to know that they were detected HIV positive. One of them, Manju, said: ""The brother of my husband badly behaved with me when my husband died of AIDS. They expelled me from the house.""

Manju's inlaws live in Tonk district. She has two daughters - one is 11-years-old and the other is 8-years-old. Both of them were tested HIV negative.

Another woman, Sita from Dholpur, had the same story to tell. She said her husband thrashed him badly when he came to know that she is infected with HIV virus. She was also expelled from the house along with her 7-year-old HIV positive daughter.

The RNP+ (women's wing) president Mona said, ""These are not the only two HIV positive women who are expelled by their inlaws. There are so many such cases which have come to light in the past.""

She said that such women have to face criticism and they also get stigmatized. ""If the husband and wife both are HIV positive and wife gets tested positive for HIV before husband, then she has to face a lot of criticism and also her husband put a blot on her character. There are so many such cases,"" Mona said.

The 200-page notebook has details of her treatment from the day she tested HIV positive. Five years ago, when her husband Raman, a rabbit-hunter, died due to AIDS-related illness what he left was a ruined house and five children. Muniyammal somehow managed to get a loan from the bank and renovated the house.

Adding fuel to the fire, she was tested positive two years after her husband's death. The couple's sons left their mother once they got to know about her status. Now, with bouts of TB attack, Muniyammal has to take care of her two daughters, Pachammal (13) and Meenammal (11). Muniyammal's is not a lone case, there are many like her in the Achapatti Street in Kariapatti, a panchayat town near Aruppukottai in Virudhunagar district.

Kariapatti has a population of 1.65 lakh. The number of HIV cases is increasing in this village due to various reasons. In 2008, there were only 17 HIV cases recorded, but in 2009 it rose to 55 and in 2010, it went to 58. There are 22 discordant couples in Kariapatti area alone. At least 45 people have been tested positive so far this year. There are three main reasons for the increased rate of HIV incidents in Kariapatti, according to Mercy Annapurni of the Blossom Trust, an NGO based in Virudhunagar.

""There is a sizable population of masons who go to Mumbai, Tirupur and Coimbatore for temporary works and return with the virus. Since Kariapatti is the town for all the other villages, transgenders from other places come in groups and camp in the town for commercial sex. The drivers of trucks passing by this area during night halt near Ramu Seethai Polytechnic in Manthiriodai for sex. The place has become a high-risk area now,"" says Annapurni.

Vadivammal Kamala, another villager says she knew about her status only after her husband's death. Living alone in an old house without any proper income, none of her four children visit their mother. Frustrated, the 49-year-old even skips her medicine. And this, according to health-worker Muthulakshmy, is a serious problem.

""Social stigma prevents many from having medicines on time. If the patients are aged, then the level of frustration they are undergoing will be high. Many even skip their medicines due to this. We have to monitor each and every one,"" says Muthulakshmy, who has been working for the welfare of the villagers for 10 years.

Even though none of the children of Muniyammal and Kamala Meenakshi did not test HIV positive for HIV as both the mothers contracted the disease from their husbands, in the later stages of their life, Rajam was unlucky.

She was not aware of her status until she gave birth to her daughter. Staying in a rented house, she struggles to meet the day's end. ""I don't have a regular income. My daughter is studying. I don't know how to survive,"" she says.

Despite being a high-risk area, the village also suffers from several a lot of civic issues. Drinking water, according to the villagers, reaches them once in a week.

""We get drinking water only once in a week. Our drainage is choked. Even though the previous government promised us houses, it has not been materialized so far,"" says Munisamy, a villager. However, talking to TOI, a panchayat official said, ""We are conducing regular health-check up for the HIV positive people in all the villages in Kariapatti. Free medicines are given to them. We will definitely look into the civic issues,"" says the official, who didn't want to be named.

The country’s National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) is against allowing finger pricks or mouth swabs to be used by individuals to know their HIV status.



A variety of tests are now available which can produce results in 1–20 minutes. The cost of these tests are also low. However, NACO says its policy is clear – testing will have to accompany pre-testing and post-result counselling. “Self-testing is against Indian national treatment guidelines. We don’t allow it,” a NACO official said.



A UNAIDS report on Monday said the world was opening up to home testing for HIV since fewer than half of those living with HIV knew their status. This is, therefore, a huge barrier to treatment scale up. In India, 40% of the 2.3 million people living with HIV don’t know that they are infected with the deadly virus.



A senior health ministry official said, “We don’t want people to self-test and then commit suicide or self harm because they are HIV positive. Also, the quality of such tests are under scrutiny. What if the person harms himself after finding himself HIV positive but he is actually HIV negative?”Around 8,000 centres across India counsel people who undertake a HIV test. In 2010, an estimated 6 million people got tested for HIV. “Counselling is vital. We tell those who get tested and are found HIV positive how to lead a healthy life, how we will connect them to care, support and treatment services, put them on nutritional support and prevent further spread of the virus. In case they are found negative, they are counselled on how to stay that way and about safe sex,” the official said.However, the UNAIDS report 2011 talks about self-testing. “Despite the advances in technology, testing is still approached with fear, accessing clinics is inconvenient and the experience of HIV testing is often stigmatizing,” the report said.“A recent national study in Kenya showed only 16% of HIV-infected adults knew that they were infected. A variety of tests, from finger pricks to mouth swabs, can now produce results in 1–20 minutes. The cost of these tests is now measured in cents,” the report added.One model, according to UNAIDS, has estimated that up to half of new HIV infections among children are caused by stigma, because women refuse to take tests or fail to collect their results. “One option to radically shift test access is self-testing at home. Information and support could be provided remotely. Most importantly, those who tested positive would need a clear access path to health care, starting with a confirmatory test. In September 2011, the United Kingdom’s House of Lords’ select committee on AIDS recommended repealing laws that prohibit home HIV testing,” the report said.","['hiv', 'positive', 'testing', 'allow', 'test', 'tested', 'support', 'report', 'treatment', 'unaids', 'india', 'tests']","NEW DELHI: India will not allow home testing for HIV.

From financial problem to fear of social stigma and ignorance about various welfare projects meant for them and treatments, these people are found struggling. Hence, to redress their problems, Alliance, an NGO, has formed advocacy groups to help HIV patients for improving their life at every stage.

But under this project, the advocacy work will gain momentum and more and more people can be given information which is important for them. Tayde said that the project started from November 1. Presently, analysis and work planning is done as the staff required for the purpose is insufficient, she said.

At present, national policy allows only voluntary testing.“It is more than evident that the women are getting the infection from their husbands, ” said Ramesh D ev k a r, MSACS project director. Lending credibility to this is a study published in the Journal of American Medical Association in 1997 by a researcher from Pune’s National Aids Research Institute, which put the percentage of women getting HIV from their husbands at 92.“We have to work towards a societal norm where couples insist on testing before tying the knot. Of course, making testing legal is not an option,” Devkar said. This year, 2,027 pregnant women in the rest of Maharashtra and 385 in Mumbai tested positive for HIV. Over the years, the number in the state has gone down: from 4,783 in 2006, to 4,552, 4,162, 3,724 and 3,361 in subsequent years. This year, the number is 2,412 (till October). But the number is still around 3,000. “That means the birth of at least 2,000 HIV-positive children. That is how high the probability of a child getting the infection from the mother is,” said Devkar.“The debate is between discrimination and the possibility of saving two lives.” Many infected women support premarital HIV testing. Kurla resident Ananda (38; name changed) said: “I have faced the stigma of living with HIV for 11 years. My husband passed away a few years ago. I was ostracized by my in-laws to the extent that they did not allow me to meet my son for two years. I got his custody only after my mother-in-law died.

""Many positive developments have taken place in the last one decade and they have bolstered our confidence to fight against social stigma and lack of awareness about HIV infection in the region. Though there is a long way to go for changing the mindset of society about the HIV infection, the progress made in the last one decade has been encouraging and promising,"" said Manoj Singh, president of Banaras Network for Positive People Living with HIV/AIDS Society , a social and voluntary organisation run by HIV positive people in the city.

Highlighting the change in attitude and approach of HIV positive people in the last one decade, he said that while HIV infected people were not ready to even talk about the infection a decade back, now, they have started to open up and look curious to know about the facilities and treatments available. The taboo attached with the infection is slowly diminishing and even the people from rural background are coming forward to share their problems and experiences, added the man, who waged a battle against the lack of awareness and social stigma along with a group of HIV positive people in the region in 2002.

The organisation provides care and support services to HIV positive people who come for screening and treatment at the ART centre, BHU. It has also come up with training and community care counselling to sensitise people in the region. How HIV positive people are opening up could be also gauged from the fact that around 700 HIV positive people have already joined the network to spread awareness in the region. Manoj Singh is living with ART treatment for the last 12 years. The network has also initiated efforts like education support to orphans (losing parents due to HIV infection) and HIV infected children (5-14 years of age).

There's precious little in them, barring a few unstable beds, some fitted with saline stands, and rickety chairs that cover less than half the dusty floors. The rest is frightfully bare even for a rural hospital.

Here, in a cubby-hole, unsanitized chamber, where breathing takes an effort, a team of two doctors, with help from a couple of nurses, helped two HIV-positive women deliver babies this week. There was no hitch and no one refused to attend to the women or humiliated them. On the contrary, the mothers have been assured that the gates of Khanakul Rural Hospital, 120 km from Kolkata - where the feat was pulled off on Monday-Tuesday - will remain open to them for treatment and counselling.

Prosenjit Pal, the lone gynaecologist at the hospital, had general physician Susanta Pal for company during the deliveries, one of which was a complicated C-section. They had an anaesthetist and nurses Amita Batabyal and Swati Pal helping them. Both women, aged about 25, are healthy and the newborns - a boy and a girl - are doing fine. Their HIV status, however, is still not clear.

The team is proud of its achievement but believes they have just done their duty. ""We were just keen to help these poor women deliver safely. Without our support they would have been helpless, probably even ostracized by the community and left to die without treatment. Ever since they sought our help nine months ago, we were determined to shield them from all adversities and make sure they delivered safely. It was not easy but we managed to do our job,"" said Prosenjit Pal.

The women, who probably contracted the deadly virus from their husbands, visited the ramshackle hospital for a pregnancy test earlier this year. To their horror, doctors found that both had HIV. They were immediately taken to the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) and briefed.

""There were a hundred odds. Touts at the hospital, neighbours and the stigma of an incurable disease with its sexual connotation. But we were determined not to let these affect the women. We took it on as a challenge and kept monitoring them regularly till they got admitted for their delivery,"" said Susanta Pal.

Regular checks, counselling and advice through their pregnancy helped the women gain confidence. The doctors and the hospital counsellor Abhijit Maity even counselled their families, convincing them that the disease, though incurable, was not as contagious as it is made out to be. And that they needed their support.

It worked. The families stood by the women and made sure no one got to know about their illness. Prosenjit Pal then got about preparing his team for the delivery. Some hospital staff initially refused to cooperate but block medical officer Sabyasachi Saha moved in and made it clear that no one would be allowed to shirk responsibility. ""I told each staff member that they would be thrown out if they refused to work for the patients. There was no murmur after that,"" said Saha.

As the delivery date approached, doctors tried to gather all the meagre resources that they had at their disposal. The OT was disinfected and the floors cleaned painstakingly. ""We knew it was not enough and that the babies were still at risk. But we left no stone unturned,"" said Susanta Pal.

Last week, it was detected that one of the women had a complication that would necessitate a C-section. So, we had to be on our toes and called for a last-minute meeting to make sure things were in order. We were tense and excited at the same time,"" said Prosenjit Pal.

The team camped at the hospital on Sunday night and readied for the first delivery on Monday - the normal one. It went off smoothly with the woman delivering a healthy boy. The next day was the real test. ""Our OT does not have the basic facilities for a Caesarean, which is why such surgeries are not done here. In this case, we couldn't refer her to another hospital, for she would certainly have been refused. Also, neither woman could afford the cost of a sustained treatment,"" said Saha.

The surgery was a success with the woman giving birth to a girl. The umbilical cord had got entangled around the baby's neck, but it was successfully negotiated by Pal. ""It was a huge relief for all of us. For nine months, we had been waiting for this day,"" he said. ""The biggest satisfaction is that we have broken the myth and set aside all the obstacles, practically doing the surgery out of nothing,"" said Susanta Pal.

Lab technician Saradindu Manna was moved to see the tears in the women's eyes after delivery. ""It reminded us that HIV-infected people have a right to live,"" he said.

For 72 hours, the entire team, including the doctors and counsellor Maity stayed put at the hospital, making sure nothing went wrong. No special precautions were taken by doctors other than gloves, an extra gown and glasses. The mothers and their babies were given Neviropine to try and make sure the newborns didn't contract the virus. ""It's still too early to know that. We are keeping our fingers crossed,"" said Prosenjit Pal.","['hospital', 'positive', 'hiv', 'script', 'delivery', 'doctors', 'susanta', 'women', 'rural', 'sure', 'pal', 'team', 'docs', 'prosenjit', 'refused']","Prosenjit Pal, the lone gynaecologist at the hospital, had general physician Susanta Pal for company during the deliveries, one of which was a complicated C-section.

However, by this time, nearly 50% of the children born to HIV positive mother die.

However, a new technique called dry blood sample testing helps in early detection of the disease and saving lives.

Under the new technique a child's blood sample is taken from the heel when the baby is about six-week-old. The blood sample is dropped over a filter paper, dried and sent to the National Centre for Disease Control (formerly known as National Institute for Prevention of Communicable Diseases). Microbiologists examine the sample using polymerase chain reaction to detect the presence of HIV virus.

In case the virus is found, the referral centre is asked to send the patient to the nearest Anti-Retroviral Therapy centre for a repeat test using whole blood samples.

Prof AK Tripathi, head of ART centre at Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj Medical University, which offers this testing, said, ""More than 90% of children born with HIV get virus from their parents. The test would help in saving lives or at least improving the quality of life led by them.""

Keeping the same in mind, early infant diagnosis services were scaled up in the state.

The dried blood testing facility is available at 32 integrated counselling and testing centres in various government hospitals and medical colleges.

Medical reports shows 33% of infected mothers would transmit the virus to their babies in the absence of preventive treatment. This happens in three different conditions. First is pregnancy in which the infection is transmitted through the mother's blood.

Experts say that the baby is more at the risk if the mother has been recently infected or is at a later stage of AIDS when the viral load is higher.

The second risk period is at the time of birth when the baby is exposed to the infected mother's vaginal secretions ad blood.

The infant is at the risk of disease during the period of breast-feeding as well.

The virus has been found in breast milk in low concentrations and studies have shown that children of HIV infected mother can get HIV infection through breast milk.","['hiv', 'disease', 'children', 'blood', 'mothers', 'testing', 'virus', 'infected', 'early', 'prevent', 'centre', 'sample', 'detection', 'infection']","However, a new technique called dry blood sample testing helps in early detection of the disease and saving lives.

This CD4 cells help us to fight against infections. Thus destruction of these cells by the virus leads to immune deficiency and susceptibility to different infections.

# How it spreads: HIV infection spreads through unsafe sexual contact, transfusion of infected blood or blood products, sharing needles to inject drugs and from mother to child during childbirth and breast-feeding. However, HIV does not spread through mosquito bites, tear, saliva, urine, by embracing, casual kissing, handshakes, working together, taking bath or swimming together with HIV infected person. In India, migrant population, truck drivers, sex workers and IV drug abusers are the worst affected. They in turn spread the disease to their wives, children and clients.

# How to get tested: Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) provides free testing and counselling. ICTC centres are present in every district hospital and medical colleges. Those who test positive are referred to the nearest Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre.

# Treatment: Once a person is infected with HIV virus, the virus can never be eliminated from the body. However, there are drugs available which can suppress the level of virus in the body. These drugs are available free of cost at all ART centres. Every HIV positive patient may not be put on treatment immediately. The treatment is started on the basis of CD4 count and stage of the disease. The treatment has to be continued lifelong. It is extremely important to adhere to the treatment to prevent failure of the drug regimen.

# Who To Approach: The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) control programme through 35 HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Societies, and 269 ART centres throughout the country. The ART centre at MLN Medical College provides HIV testing, treatment, counseling, nutritional advice and AVR drugs to the registered patients.

# Protection & Support To Children affected with AIDS: In the short term, National Aids Control Programme is reaching out to as many children living with HIV as possible to provide them with the treatment and the care and support services that they need.

""I inquired about her and came to know she was HIV positive and ostracized by her society. Anything and everything done by her, including food cooked by her, was a no-no for her family and neighbours,"" Heera told TOI over phone from his village on Thursday.



Heera fell for Rani. ""I would often make telephone calls to her and inquire about her health,"" he said and added they tied the knot in March 2008 with the consent of their families.



The couple's joy knew no bounds when their first daughter, Deepali, tested HIV negative.



""She was born in December 2008. We strictly followed the prescriptions of doctors during the pregnancy of Rani,"" he said.



The couple was blessed with a second child in June 2010.



""She is 17 months old. I cannot get her tested for HIV till she attains the age of 18 months,"" Heera said and added she, however, looks like a healthy baby.Heera used to run a grocery shop before his health complications arose. Now, the only source of income for Heera's nine-member joint family is the pension his father draws from the railways as its retired loco pilot.""We spent thousands of rupees on medicines every month as the government provides only first-line ART drugs free of cost in Bihar,"" Heera said and added he often shudders at the thought of what would be the fate of his family the day the railways stopped paying pension.BNP+ president Gyan Ranjan recalled Heera was hopeless personified when he met him in 2006.""It's heartening to see he is living a happy life now,"" he said and hoped Heera's happiness would continue for long.","['hiv', 'positive', 'heera', 'aids', 'bihar', 'village', 'rani', 'world', 'tested', 'day', 'bihars', 'added', 'brave', 'family', 'society', 'couple']","PATNA: Being HIV positive is not the end of life.

Another reason is that the state is home to 19% of all mines in India, employing over 5 lakh migrant workers. Also, everyday 25,000 truckers travel through Rajasthan. The prevalence of HIV is very high among the truckers.Health minister A A Khan said, ""Our efforts are to bring the numbers to zero by 2015 and we are working on to achieve the target.""In Jaipur and Udaipur, NRHM would assist the RSACS to spread the awareness by launching a campaign with Red Ribbon buses from December 15.Joint director of information education and communication Pradeep Choudhary said, ""We will hold camps in the interior areas of the districts where primary health centres are quite far away.""Ajmer chief medical and health officer Dr Laxman Harchandani said, ""In Ajmer there are 1,650 people living with HIV.

So far, there is little clinical experience or treatment knowledge about the other type of HIV . In the absence of clear protocols from the National Aids Control Organization (Naco), most clinicians are groping in the dark about the treatment regime to be followed.There is an equal amount of confusion in diagnosis for want of appropriate testing kits. While both HIV- 1 and 2 have similar modes of transmission and could cause similar opportunistic infections, the latter takes longer to manifest.Studies abroad have shown how people have lived near normal lives for decades without showing any symptoms of illness . However, mothers infected with pure HIV-2 can pass on the infection to their newborns. ""Presently, we have nothing very effective to deal with that,"" said a Naco official who did not wish to be named.In Mumbai, the Anti-Retroviral Treatment (ART) centre at JJ Hospital, earlier headed by Dr Alaka Deshpande, was the first to detect HIV-2 infections, document and treat the cases in the city. ""In the last one year, we have diagnosed around 140 patients with HIV-2 ,"" said Deshpande . She insisted that it was high time the government took cognizance of HIV-2 and start actively studying and monitoring it. ""We are facing a situation where patients could develop resistance ,"" she added.A study undertaken by doctors at BYL Nair Hospital between January 2007 and December 2009 showed that 140 out of 42,961 patients had HIV-2 infection . Of these, 90 were exclusively HIV-2 infected, whereas the remaining 59 clients were co-infected with HIV- 1 and 2.The Naco official said efforts to understand HIV-2 have begun . ""Protocols on how to test samples, study viral loads, etc are being worked upon,"" said the Naco officer. Currently, there are no standalone kits widely available to test HIV-2 . Head of the microbiology department at JJ Hospital Dr Ameeta Joshi said that for over a year they have been sending data and samples to the laboratory at the National Institute of Immunohaematology (NII) at Parel.","['hospital', 'hiv', 'study', 'type', 'patients', 'experts', 'naco', 'test', 'littleknown', 'hiv2', 'say', 'fight', 'treatment', 'infection']","MUMBAI: With the taming of the predominant HIV-1 type, responsible for a majority of the 2.7 million infection cases in the country, experts say it is time to evaluate the incidence and seriousness of the HIV-2 infection.

Although official statistics say that out of a total of over 17,664 samples screened till date, only about 80 cases were positive, a little more than 10 were full-blown AIDS cases and a few deaths wer e reported, this could be the tip of the iceberg.In fact, there is also a feeling that the state government is still denying that AIDS is an ‘issue’ in the state. Only the families of people who have suffered from AIDS and felt the pain and trauma related to the disease seem to understand that the disease poses a big threat.A rapid assessment survey conducted by the United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP), the Regional Office for South Asia (ROSA) a few years ago suggested that out of some 320 sample of drug users interviewed in Shillong, 11%, i.e. 36 were female. Only a small number out of those surveyed indicated that they were at risk of acquiring and transmitting the HIV virus, the survey report said, adding the majority perceived no possibility of contacting HIV.Senior officials at the Indian Red Cross Association, Shillong branch, said the campaign hoped to encourage people to address the vulnerability of women and girls to HIV. “Equality for women helps fight AIDS, it needs to be asserted,” said an official.Moreover, lack of economic alternatives where women are forced into flesh trade, lower literacy rate, limited access to information and appropriate health care services places women at greater risk, health officials pointed out.“In fact, to protect themselves from HIV infection, women must not only rely on their own skills, attitudes and behaviour regarding use of condoms, but also on their ability to convince their partners to use them,” an official emphasized. “Prevention strategies must address gender norms and other crucial issues in sexual decision-making, otherwise, campaigns, sensitization programmes etc would be futile,” she underscored.Meanwhile, the department of social work, Martin Luther Christian University, observed the World AIDS Day here today by organizing a poster competition.

The lawyer said that police authority was sitting tight over the complaint, and the parents were forced to approach the superintendent of police.

Meenakshi, who is in her 30s, and her organization, Kovai District HIV Nalla Sangam (CD HANS), have played an important role in encouraging HIV/AIDS-affected persons to come out and form a network to fight discrimination.

""HIV affected individuals face a lot of problems. We came out with this initiative so that the affected could have a space to share their common problems,"" she says. With seven people on board, they started CD HANS as a network of HIV infected people. ""Now there are around 2000 members in our network in the district"", she says.

Today, the organization conducts peer group programmes, support group activities and other joint initiatives. She says that peer group programmes help patients reconcile with the issues related to the disease. ""When everyone hears each other's story, it helps them garner a lot of emotional support,"" she explains.

HIV patients are at first put through a get together that happens twice a month. Then, they meet during alternate months. ""The frequent get-togethers will help people overcome the fears and myths associated. With anti-retroviral treatment (ART), an infected person can live a normal life for more than 30 years. Most would have panicked and lost hope of living after detecting themselves to be HIV infected. They find it a new birth"", she says.

Meenakshi is proud that many have found new lives through her group. ""Fortunately, we have plenty of financial assistance programmes and other initiatives. Through self-help groups of the HIV affected, many have started their own initiatives.""

(Antibody is an infection-fighting protein produced by our immune system when it detects harmful substances).The hunt has begun to identify 100 volunteers belonging to a rare group of HIV infected patients who stay healthy for years without requiring life-saving antiretroviral treatment (ART). These antibodies in their blood are the ones that bars HIV from entering their blood cells and replicating, thereby progressing to AIDS.Scientists say these antibodies would ultimately reveal the Achilles heel of the virus and help create the elusive vaccine. This is part of International Aids Vaccine Initiative’s (IAVI) programme called Protocol G, a global hunt for such antibodies launched in 2006.So far, blood samples of 1,800 such HIV patients have been screened across 12 countries and 19 broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAbs) have been identified. A bNAb is an antibody capable of stopping a variety of HIV subtypes from infecting their target cells.“Only a minority of people who are infected with HIV produce bNAbs. Although HIV is a wildly mutable virus, certain parts of it are relatively resistant to change. These parts are essential to the virus’s ability to infect, and they are the elements of HIV that bNAbs target,” experts said.Just a few weeks ago, department of biotechnology (DBT) cleared the proposal to roll out Protocol G in the country. It is being implemented by IAVI and YRG Care from Chennai – the same organization that isolated the first HIV case in India in 1986.The blood samples collected from the 100 volunteers will be tested at Translational Health Sciences and Technology Institute (THSTI), which is being built in Gurgaon.IAVI’s India chief Dr Rajat Goyal told TOI that “This is a landmark project for India. We are presently identifying volunteers, who are at least 18 years, infected with HIV at least three years ago but has not received ART. By April, samples will be picked up and tested against a standard panel of HIV isolates by the end of 2012. We will then know whether there is a population of interest from whom these bNAb can be identified and characterized.”Careful study of bNAbs is expected to reveal vulnerabilities of the different types of HIV. Most importantly, scientists expect that they can use information about how bNAbs bind to HIV to construct immunogens — the active ingredients of vaccines — that elicit similar antibodies. The more such antibodies researchers have in hand, the more clues they can get about how best to target HIV with a vaccine.The project has tested HIV patients in Thailand , the UK, the US, Nigeria, South Africa Kenya , Australia and Zambia to identify bNAbs.HIV infects 7,100 people daily. The quest to develop an AIDS vaccine has consumed scientists for 25 years since the discovery of HIV. Scientists say HIV is the most mutable virus ever encountered. A number of different subtypes of the virus, known as clades, circulate in different regions of the world. Within those clades there is considerable variability, and, beyond that, the virus mutates furiously within the people it has infected.Second, because no one is known to have cleared an HIV infection, scientists do not know which elements of the immune response must be engaged to control the virus — and thus are uncertain how to replicate such responses.The immune system has a very narrow window of opportunity in which to neutralize HIV before the virus establishes a lifelong infection.","['hiv', 'elusive', 'volunteers', 'create', 'blood', 'vaccine', 'virus', 'fray', 'bnabs', 'tested', 'scientists', 'antibodies', 'antibody', 'india']","NEW DELHI: Could an antibody from the blood of an Indian HIV patient help create the elusive HIV vaccine ?

National AIDS Control Organisation’s latest figures show that besides high risk populations like sex workers, the highest burden of HIV is among migrants — 3.6%, which is 10 times the HIV prevalence among the general population.With migration rates increasing, the prevalence will only get worse. According to the 2001 census, 30.1% of the population was considered to have migrated (314 million) — a considerable increase from 27.4% in 1991. NACO has, therefore, identified 108 railway stations – which are both source and destination of migrants travelling in search of work. These are now the focus of the country’s anti-HIV fight.Red Ribbon Express (RRE), which chugs out of Delhi on Thursday, will stop at most of these 108 identified stations to test migrants for HIV besides carrying out counselling and spreading anti-HIV messages. During it’s year-long journey, RRE will traverse through 23 states, cover 30,000 km and stop at 162 stations.Speaking to TOI, a NACO official said, “Migrants are one of the major focus areas this time with the RRE. Last year, RRE stopped at 152 stations and reached out to 8 million people directly. This time, around 30-40 stops will be to mainly address migrants.”NACO has identified 122 districts with high out-migration across 11 states which are on priority for starting up community level interventions. Another 75 important transit locations have been identified across these 122 districts from where these migrants usually board long distance trains/buses to reach their destinations.Studies on the relationship between migration and HIV conducted by NACO in three popular migration corridors — Ganjam-Surat, Darbhanga-Delhi and Azamgarh-Mumbai — threw up shocking findings. It showed that two to four times more number of informal workers had non-regular partners or visited sex workers with only 25% using condoms. Around 5% male migrants and 13% female migrants reported sexually transmitted infections, nearly double the national average.According to NACO, the risk of HIV infection for migrants seems to arise from a multitude of factors -- risky behaviour, lack of social and economic security and involvement in peer driven risk taking activities.In a recent study by UNDP (through Population Council), the risk of HIV among migrants was reported to be 1.68 times more likely than non-migrants. Majority of migrants are also often poorly educated, with majority reporting less than five years of formal education. This contributes to limited knowledge of HIV transmission A study conducted in 30 villages in the northern parts of Karnataka revealed that 40% of single men and 35% of married migrant men had non-marital sexual relationships in the last 12 months.For a long time, India has lived with the belief that migrants are at risk only at destination sites when they are away from home and their spouse. However, recent evidence proves otherwise. Returned migrants continue to fuel the epidemic since most infected migrants tend to return to source when they are sick.A study of married men found returned migrants were 3.86 times as likely to be HIV positive as compared to active married migrant men. Among men reporting sex with a non-spousal unpaid female sex partner in the past year, only 19% of men reported consistent condom use. This impacts the women and spouses of informal workers/migrants at the source, making them vulnerable to infections from their husband.RRE has been recognized as the world’s largest mass mobilization drive on HIV. Last year, around 80 lakh people were reached through the train and outreach activities.Around 81,000 district resource persons were trained, 36,000 people got themselves tested for HIV and 28,000 people received general health check-up services.Impact assessment of RRE indicated that the comprehensive knowledge of routes of HIV transmission, methods of prevention, condom use, STI prevention and treatment was significantly higher among respondents exposed to the RRE project compared to those not exposed.","['hiv', 'rre', 'sex', 'naco', 'general', 'identified', 'migrants', 'population', 'migration', 'risk', 'men', 'times', 'prevalent']","National AIDS Control Organisation’s latest figures show that besides high risk populations like sex workers, the highest burden of HIV is among migrants — 3.6%, which is 10 times the HIV prevalence among the general population.With migration rates increasing, the prevalence will only get worse.

NG Ganar, MLC from the Teachers' Constituency, said, ""It is the government's job to help these students and also to frame some strict laws regarding their privacy so that they are not discriminated in school.""

He adds that the statistics regarding students have been sourced from various government reports. ""There have been incidents where students are refused admission, expelled or ostracized within the school campus but very few of them reach the authorities. What we need is a strong law in place which will ensure that the medical history of students or their parents is not disclosed to the school management at all,"" said Ganar.

Dr Milind Mane, who has been working with HIV patients for almost two decades, said a distinction has to be made between affected and infected students. ""HIV affected students are those whose parents are or were infected with the virus. This category may also include students who themselves have been infected with HIV. We do not have medical data about how many students in the state, out of the 20,000 affected, are themselves infected. However the National Aids Control Organization (NACO) says that on an average 11 per cent of HIV affected people in the country are infected,"" said Dr. Mane.

There is currently no data available on how many HIV affected students are present in Nagpur. But the fact that discrimination in schools happens in the state has been documented by a national level advocacy group. The Centre for Advocacy and Research (CFAR) prepared a dossier on the discrimination related incidents between 2005-2010 in Maharashtra. The dossier mentions that 10 major incidents related to stigma and discrimination in schools occurred during that time period and Nagpur district is one of the regions where these incidents have occurred.

A couple of years the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) started a school exclusively for HIV affected students, but was closed down after opposition. Dr. Mane, said, ""The school was started so that these students would feel more comfortable and that would help them concentrate on their studies only. 27 students had enrolled out of which 17 were infected with HIV. Then there was strong opposition by some NGOs and politicians who said that having a separate school similar to discrimination and eventually it was shut down.""

The civic body however denies any political pressure and cites enrolment figures as an issue. Ram Dongarwar, education officer, said, ""Students affected by HIV were chosen from various civic schools and enrolled at this special school located near Indora Chowk. ""

However due to low enrolment figures we had to shut it down.""

Shockingly, a repeat test had shown that the patient was not HIV positive, but the technician did not reveal this result.

With no framework of law governing the testing of HIV-AIDS in the country, it has become the personal responsibility of doctors to keep a check on ethical and legal issues while performing such tests.

To avoid more such tragedies in the future, members of the city branch of Indian Medical Association (IMA) met to discuss important issues related to HIV tests on Tuesday. Topics like guidelines of governing bodies regarding these tests and the difficulties faced by private practitioners when they suspect HIV positive status of a patients were discussed.

Programme officer of District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) Ganesh Parihar introduced the concept of public-private partnership in terms of counselling and testing. ""As testing is voluntary and not mandatory in India, it is of utmost importance for the person undergoing the test to give his consent for it. This consent should be based on proper information,"" he insisted.

Parihar also said that doctors who are willing to set up an Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) within their premises can avail free testing kits and training for their staff.

Renowned HIV consultant Dr Milind Bhurshundi believed that provider-initiated testing and counselling would give way to more efficient and speedy clinical decisions. ""In some cases, one consent form is used for taking consent on more than one issue. Such hidden consents can't be used for HIV testing. Lack of time, not having a trained counsellor and less infrastructure can hamper doctors despite their willingness to have a counselling and testing centre

,"" he said.

""After consulting all stakeholders over a period of two years, a proposed HIV bill is being prepared,"" he informed. Since these guidelines may soon turn into statutory law, he asked the doctors to be prepared for it.

""When a doctor suspects a patient is suffering from HIV, they just don't know how to handle the situation. What most of us do not realize is the fact that counselling is required even before getting someone tested. Along with passing useful information, it can also help in bringing about behavioural changes in the suspect,"" opined surgeon Dr Ajay Kate.

Consequently, they were thrown out of the home along with the employee. “To take revenge, this employee informed the child right activists,” she alleged.Sunita said that she had given information to police about her son’s whereabouts on Wednesday night.","['hiv', 'positive', 'girls', 'abuse', 'foundation', 'sexual', 'child', 'night', 'arrested', 'drone', 'gupta', 'victims', 'employee', 'sexually', 'man']","GURGAON: The manager of a city-based NGO was arrested on Thursday for allegedly sexually abusing two minor girls, who were inmates of the childcare centre.One of the victims is HIV positive .

The Gurgaon administration has not been able to find a permanent shelter for these children, even as the south Delhi NGO they were shifted to has expressed inability to provide them with permanent accommodation. The NGO says there is not enough space and infrastructure to take them in.



The children are aged between six and 12 years, and some of them need special care as they are traumatized, said sources.



Anjali Gopalan, director of NAZ foundation— a home for HIV positive children in the capital—said they have two separate dormitories for boys and girls that can accommodate up to 25 children. “Of these, 24 beds are full. The rescued children are being kept in the room reserved for providing urgent medical aid to patients. There is lack of space, few toilets and scarcity of water among other things,” she said.The NGO director said the Gurgaon administration had requested them to accommodate the children for two days, so that they could find a suitable shelter. “Now, they are not ready to take responsibility. There has been no word from the Gurgaon administration,” Gopalan claimed.P C Meena, deputy commissioner, Gurgaon, told TOI that they are trying to arrange a permanent shelter for the children at the earliest. “In Haryana, there are no government-run homes for HIV positive children.

A source said: “The patient is yet to be started on antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV infection. Such patients are usually treated for TB at the beginning. Once they stabilize, ART is started.”TB is the commonest HIV-related opportunistic infection. An expert summed up the deadly nature of the combined infection saying that when HIV brings down immunity, TB catches up. “The two need to be dealt with in a synchronized manner. Efforts and the machinery to integrate the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) with the HIV programme need to be strengthened.”As per norm, patients received by registered TB centres are counselled to go for HIV testing and vice versa. Since HIV testing is voluntary, many give it a miss. Doctors say TB patients are often not counselled enough to understand the importance of HIV testing.According to data compiled by the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS), out of 1.01 lakh registered TB patients, only 40,202, or 39%, were referred to Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) for HIV testing in 2011 till September. Among them, 1,678 patients tested positive for HIV. In Mumbai, the prevalence of HIV among TB patients is 7-8%.Dr S S Kudalkar of MDACS said mortality among patients suffering from both infections has halved in recent years. “Till a few years ago, the mortality rate (among HIV-TB co-infection patients) was around 8%. Now it is 4%.”He said HIV patients with TB “probably have a higher risk of recurrence and death”. “At no point can these patients afford to discontinue their treatments as that could give rise to (drug) resistance.” A chest specialist said HIV clubbed with resistant TB may be tricky, but not impossible to manage. “Yes, drug interactions (in such a patient) can have more side effects, but it can be handled if the patient comes in at an early stage.”","['hiv', 'infection', 'tb', 'patients', 'testing', 'deadly', 'tuberculosis', 'xxdr', 'strain', 'patient', 'control', 'man', 'mumbai']","MUMBAI: A patient with extra-extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XXDR TB) has tested positive for HIV .

The incident came to light after Valli (42), (name changed), the boy's mother went to the drop-in centre run by Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) to seek help from B V Babu, president of the Madurai Network of Positive People.

Speaking to TOI, Valli (42), who is also an HIV+ said, ""I fell sick about two years ago and blood reports revealed that I tested positive for the deadly virus. I have been on medication ever since,"" she said. Surprisingly, her husband Kaliappan, a tricycle puller, elder daughter Easwari (18) and youngest son Parameswaran (10) have tested negative. Valli said that she never underwent any major blood transfusion or surgery and has no clue as to how she contracted the virus.

Valli said she had borrowed Rs 30,000 from a local papad manufacturer to meet the cost of her treatment two years ago. ""Today, this amount has increased to Rs 1 lakh. The only way I will be able to clear my debt is when my sons finish their education and get good jobs. But now, my elder son's future hangs in balance,"" she said.

Her brother, who had promised to get his son married to her eldest daughter, has now changed his mind, on coming to know of his sister's HIV status. ""I fear that my children may not be able to lead a normal life because of my disease. All I want is the society to treat them as equals,"" she said.

Her son Kathir (name changed) used to fall sick frequently and a blood test done last year had revealed that he was HIV positive. But he was not put on the ART drug as his CD4 count was 475 and the drug is given to patients only when their CD4 dips below 350, said Babu.

Kathir looks puny and thin compared to his younger brother who also studies in the same school. ""We were asked to pay Rs eight each for a blood test to identify our blood groups for the ID card. The teacher asked me if I was under treatment for any specific disease and asked me to bring my booklet,"" he said.

Babu says that this is a clear violation of human rights. ""I think the laboratory, which tested the boys may have suspected something and asked the school to verify details,"" he said. The boy said that the teacher started discriminating against him soon after perusing the tiny notebook which contained details about his treatment.

Meanwhile, the boy's younger brother also stayed away from school as one of the teachers had allegedly told him to ensure that his brother did not come to school from Monday onwards. ""My brother had been sitting alone in one corner of the classroom and the boys in my class are asking me why,"" he said.

When The Times of India contacted the district elementary education officer M K T Subhashini, she said that the issue had been taken up with the school's administration. However, the school authorities had denied the allegations and had told her that he did not attend school as he was sick.","['hiv', 'positive', 'asked', 'school', 'blood', 'valli', 'asks', 'tested', 'boys', 'away', 'boy', 'son', 'stay', 'madurai', 'brother']","MADURAI: A primary school in Keela Sandhaipettai on Monday resorted to the extreme step of stopping a 12-year-old boy from coming to school after one of the teachers discovered that he was HIV positive, his distraught mother has claimed.

They were demanding a white paper on the pact and wide consultation with stakeholders before implementation. The rally with protesters carrying giant inflated medicine pills was held from Mandi House to Parliament Street around 10 am.

The support group for people with HIV AIDS, including the Delhi Network of Positive People and Médecins Sans Frontières — an international, independent organization for medical humanitarian aid — claimed that certain clauses in the deal like ‘intellectual property enhancements’ and ‘data exclusivity’ could effectively block the production of generic drugs by Indian companies.“Millions of patients in poor countries, many in Africa, are unable to pay sky-high Western prices to treat illnesses that include HIV, malaria, asthma and cancer. For HIV alone, India makes more than 80% of the world’s medicines,” said Leena Menghaney from MSF.She said that two broad provisions in the agreement — one on intellectual property rights and the other on investor lawsuits — would make it much easier for international pharmaceutical giants to sue the Indian government, drug manufacturers and distributors. It will curtail production of many lifesaving drugs, or cause prices to increase to levels many cannot afford, said Menghaney.Kavaljit Singh, director, Madhyam said due to competition among generics producers in India, the price of first-line HIV medicines has dropped by more than 99%, from US$10,000 per person per year in 2000 to roughly $150 presently. “This significant price decrease has supported the massive expansion of HIV treatment worldwide: more than 80% of the HIV medicines used to treat 6.6 million people in developing countries come from Indian producers, and 90% of pediatric HIV medicines are Indian-produced. MSF and other treatment providers also use Indian generic medicines to treat other diseases and conditions,” he said. The activists demanded that the government make the details of the agreement being discussed public and hold wide consultations before giving any final approval to the same. “Public view must be considered,” said Biraj Patnaik, principal adviser to the commissioners of the Supreme Court on the Right to Food.","['medicines', 'hiv', 'property', 'protest', 'patients', 'indian', 'drugs', 'costlier', 'agreement', 'public', 'wide', 'treat', 'treatment', 'india']","NEW DELHI: Hundreds of HIV-positive people staged a march in the city on Friday to protest against the free trade agreement between the European Union and India.

Patients are also dependant on the free second line ART treatment as it could cost about Rs 10,000 in a month.A medical source told TOI said the problems started soon after former ART in-charge Dr Alaka Deshpande quit in November 2011. “Monthly meetings, which were held to select patients after their viral load examinations were done, just stopped. Without those meetings the patients could not be selected,” said a JJ Hospital source.Dr BB Rewari, National Aids Control Organization (NACO) ART consultant, said, “There was no new doctor trained to replace the previous nodal person. The new team headed by Dr V K Joglekar has requested us to sensitize them about the ART. We will be doing that soon.” he said.

Overall, HIV prevalence in FSWs was found to be 12%.In 26 countries deemed to have medium or high background HIV prevalence, some 31% of FSWs were HIV- positive, and were 12 times more likely to be infected than women from the general population.“We identified consistent evidence of substantially higher levels of HIV among FSWs compared with all women of reproductive age in low and middle-income countries in all regions with data,” the authors said.“These findings suggest an urgent need to scale up access to quality HIV-prevention programming and services among FSWs because of their heightened burden of disease and likelihood of onward transmission through high numbers of sexual partners as clients. Improvement of linkages to antiretroviral treatment and retention in care is crucial. The role of stigma, discrimination and violence targeting female sex workers globally will be required to reduce the disproportionate disease burden among these women,” they added.“When reviewing the data from the past five years, FSWs still carry more than a 50-time increased odds of HIV infection in India. Since HIV prevalence is a lagging indicator of prevention success, time is needed to reveal the benefit of these programmes in terms of the absolute burden of HIV among female sex workers in India. Nonetheless, the disproportionate burden of HIV among these sex workers, even in settings where progressive programmes exist, emphasizes the need to increase coverage by increasing scale of prevention programmes and decreasing barriers to access,” is how The Lancet summed about the situation in India.In India, women account for around one million out of 2.5 million estimated number of people living with HIV/AIDS. The National Aids Control Organization estimates that around 4.9% of FSWs in India are HIV- positive.The estimated number of new annual HIV infections has declined by more than 50% over the past decade. India had about 1.2 lakh new HIV infections in 2009 as against 2.7 lakh in 2000.While this trend is evident in most states, some low prevalence states have shown an increase in the number of new infections over the past two years. Of the 1.2 lakh estimated new infections in 2009, the six high-prevalence states account for only 39% of the cases, while states like Odisha, Bihar, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat account for 41% of new infections.The adult HIV prevalence at national level has continued its steady decline from estimated level of 0.41% in 2000 through 0.36% in 2006 to 0.31% in 2009. In India, about 40% people don’t even know their HIV status.The prevalence of HIV among key population at higher risk of infection – notably sex workers, people who inject drugs and men who have sex with men – is high in several Asian countries. However, the virus is spreading to other sections of the population through the years.","['hiv', 'fsws', 'suffering', 'workers', 'sex', 'states', 'women', 'prevalence', 'countries', 'infections', 'female', 'india']","The role of stigma, discrimination and violence targeting female sex workers globally will be required to reduce the disproportionate disease burden among these women,” they added.“When reviewing the data from the past five years, FSWs still carry more than a 50-time increased odds of HIV infection in India.

""I was shunned by everybody, including the hospital staff treating me, due to my HIV status. But after the test last week, they have started touching me again,"" said Hadibandhu Sahoo, who has been undergoing treatment for a broken spine.

Sahoo had tested HIV positive in April 2011 at Swami Vivekanad National Institute of Rehabilitation Training and Research, an institute of the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment in Cuttack district.

Sahoo, who hails from Ghantapada village in Angul district, used to work as a security guard in a biscuit manufacturing company in Bhuj, Gujarat. He had broken his spine during the 2001 Gujarat earthquake and underwent a series of treatment at various health centres. His spine, however, refused to heal and he was finally admitted to the Vivekanad National Institute for treatment from April to June 2011, where he was diagnosed HIV positive.

TOI had highlighted his plight in an article published on July 6, 2011. ""I was discharged from the hospital in August and started a paan shop in Talcher with the help of the local MLA. However, people who knew my HIV status would avoid the shop,"" he said.

The 50-year-old wheelchair-bound man had to be admitted to Capital Hospital when he injured his back again recently after he slipped and fell while taking a bath. In a fresh test conducted at the Integrated Counelling and Testing Centre (ICTC) at Capital Hospital, Sahoo was found to be HIV negative last week.

""The recent fall was a blessing in disguise for me. I have got a new lease of life after the fresh diagnosis. I had started cursing my life earlier,"" said Sahoo, adding, ""Last time when I was hospitalized, nobody would come near me because of my HIV positive status. Now finally I am being treated as a normal person.""

When contacted, the hospitals defended the test reports. ""We rely on the rapid test kits supplied by National AIDS Control Organisation, which has a margin of error,"" said R N Mohanty, director in-charge of Vivekanad National Institute.

Capital Hospital authorities said the ICTC test is a confirmatory test. ""I can't comment about test done elsewhere but ICTC tests are regarded confirmatory.

An ongoing study at JJ Hospital’s gynaecology department, for instance, is looking at fertility and reproductive desires of HIV-positive people.“We are studying if men and women who have been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS understand the emotional, social and financial implications of having a child,” said Dr Rekha Daver, who heads the gynaecology department. The fiveyear-long study, which is being done jointly with the Indian Council for Medical Research, started last year. The idea is to develop a better counselling mechanism for HIV-positive people. Incidentally, the National AIDS Control Organisation has recognised JJ Hospital’s gynaecology department as a Centre of Excellence in the Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission of HIV/AIDS programme.“We have delivered 1,073 HIVpositive women in the last 11 years. We have also managed to control mother-to-child transmission of HIV to a great deal. In fact, of the last 100 deliveries, 95 children are free of the virus,’’ said Dr Daver.Considering the number of HIVpositive people who come to JJ Hospital , it’s not surprising that the fertility desire study is being done here. “The study involves hours of intense counselling, taking down notes and a check-up . We have finished interviewing around 20 people so far,’’ said Dr Daver.She added patients usually say having a child is their ultimate dream. “Social pressure as well as the woman’s own mental makeup contributes to this decision,” said Dr Daver. Every pregnant woman who comes to JJ Hospital’s gynaecology department is counselled and voluntarily tested for HIV. They are informed of the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and possibility of the children becoming AIDS orphans. “But many still want their biological babies,” she said.A Harvard University study a few years back noted that “spousal, family, community and cultural influences greatly shape HIV-positive women’s desire to become pregnant. Studies in India , South Africa, Taiwan and Vietnam have demonstrated the weight of culture-specific spousal and family wishes that a woman will need to consider besides her own desires and HIV status.”Dr Daver added many HIV-positive women opt for pregnancy as they are worried about discrimination in society if they are childless.“HIV-positive women have as much social problems as medical issues,’’ she said.","['positive', 'hiv', 'having', 'study', 'hivpositive', 'jj', 'child', 'women', 'transmission', 'gynaecology', 'dr', 'department', 'social']","Incidentally, the National AIDS Control Organisation has recognised JJ Hospital’s gynaecology department as a Centre of Excellence in the Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission of HIV/AIDS programme.“We have delivered 1,073 HIVpositive women in the last 11 years.

An AIDS patient cannot be denied employment or sacked except with a written assessment of an independent healthcare provider that the person poses a risk of transmission of virus to others at the workplace.

These are some of the path-breaking provisions in a law drafted by the government that provides for stiff punishment for discrimination against those who are HIV-positive and for propagating hatred against the victims of the infection.The ‘new deal’ for a stigmatized group that is often condemned twice is in the final stage of approval with the Centre finalizing the long-pending HIV-AIDS (Prevention & Control) Bill that was caught in differences between ministries of law and health. It lays down inviolable rights for patients and stringent duties for individuals and institutions dealing with them.

HIV test not must for getting jobs, proposes bill

The proposed law states that testing for AIDS cannot be a pre-requisite for employment or for access to healthcare, education or public places. It would mean that HIV afflicted people refused entry to public places like hotels or restaurants or denied purchase or renting of house can move an ombudsman. They can also move courts against discrimination.



Also, a person with HIV virus cannot be sacked or denied employment except with a written assessment of a qualified and independent healthcare provider that the afflicted person indeed poses risks of transmission.



Any person below 18 years of age and a woman of any age will have the right to live in a shared property, as a safeguard against eviction due to stigma. The medical costs will be factored in during any maintenance settlements. This can help women in divorce cases.



The law would put in place a National Authority in the form of a Department of AIDS Control (NACO), which will formulate guidelines and rules for protocols like treatment of HIV patients through Anti-Retroviral Therapy or rules for blood banks or diagnostic centres.



An ombudsman in every state, as the forum to adjudicate violations under the law, would help the aggrieved to avoid time-consuming legal proceedings in civil courts.



The law seeks to deter rampant victimization of HIV-positive persons. A key clause prescribes a jail term of three months to two years for any spoken or written word, or display of information or advertisement, which could expose HIV-positive persons to any form of hostility. This can also lead to a fine up to Rs one lakh.



The inviolable right of an HIV person, as part of the first-ever codification of rights and duties, may help patients who face subtle or overt discrimination with no forum for grievance redressal.



The law asserts no person can be forced to take an HIV test. For such a test, the authority would have to secure consent after due counseling on all pros and cons. Similarly, no HIV-positive person can be subjected to medical treatment without his consent – a decision which should be made after he has been informed about the risks and benefits of the treatment.



A judicial order would be the only exception to force an AIDS test on a person apart from “screening purpose” in a blood bank.The HIV positive persons would finally enjoy guaranteed confidentiality. No person can be compelled to disclose his HIV status (except under a court directive). In a strict deterrent, the law states that if a person reveals the identity of an HIV-positive, as information that is passed on as part of legal proceedings, he could face a fine of up to Rs 1 lakh.To balance the threat of transmission with stringent non-disclosure law, a doctor can disclose his patient’s HIV-positive status to his partner if he believes there is a risk of infection. However, he would have to guard against such disclosure about a woman if there is apprehension that it can lead to her being abandoned or facing violence.The ombudsman can impose an initial fine of Rs 10,000, and thereafter Rs 5,000 a day for non-compliance of orders.To ensure that non-discrimination clause of Act is followed at workplace, every institution with over 100 employees would have to appoint a senior officer to deal with violations of the law.","['discrimination', 'hiv', 'aids', 'hivinfected', 'patients', 'hivpositive', 'test', 'person', 'strict', 'law', 'persons', 'covering', 'written', 'rs', 'soon']","HIV test not must for getting jobs, proposes billThe proposed law states that testing for AIDS cannot be a pre-requisite for employment or for access to healthcare, education or public places.

The men had allegedly said that they would not allow the body to be buried unless his relatives settled the amount immediately.

The deceased, Gnana Arockiam (38) was working as a load man at Malaithathampatti in Manapparai and had contracted the HIV virus six years ago. Father of two children, Arockiam was undergoing treatment at the Trichy Government Hospital. When his wife came to know that her husband had contracted HIV, she left for her ancestral home at Pothamettupetti along with their children.

Meanwhile, loneliness coupled with the presence of the disease made Arockiam's life miserable and he attempted suicide on Wednesday by jumping into a well in Malaithathampatti. On getting information, the Manapparai station fire officer rushed to the well and saved Arockiam. He was admitted to the Trichy GH but breathed his last on Wednesday night.

The study demonstrates for the first time that engineering stem cells to form immune cells that target HIV is effective in suppressing the virus in living tissues in an animal model, said lead scientist Scott G Kitchen. He added: “We believe that this study lays the groundwork for the potential use of this type of an approach in combating HIV infection in infected individuals , in hopes of eradicating the virus from the body.”



In their previous research, the scientists took CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes — the “killer” T cells that help fight infection — from an HIV-infected individual and identified the molecule known as the T cell receptor, which guides T cell in recognizing and killing HIV-infected cells.

In their latest research, the scientists at California University similarly engineered human blood stem cells and found that they can form mature T cells that can attack HIV in tissues where the virus resides and replicates.They did so by using a surrogate model, the humanized mouse, in which HIV infection closely resembles the disease and its progression in humans . In a series of tests on the mice’s peripheral blood, plasma and organs conducted two weeks and six weeks after introducing the engineered cells, the scientists found that the number of CD4 “helper” T cells — which become depleted as a result of HIV infection — increased, while levels of HIV in the blood decreased.CD4 cells are white blood cells that are an important component of immune system , helping to fight off infections . These results indicated that the engineered cells were capable of developing and migrating to the organs to fight infection there, the ‘PLoS Pathogens’ journal reported.“We believe that this is the first step in developing a more aggressive approach in correcting the defects in the human T cell responses that allow HIV to persist in infected people,” Kitchen said.","['hiv', 'stem', 'blood', 'human', 'virus', 'cells', 'scientists', 'hunt', 'fight', 'engineered', 'tweaked', 'infection', 'kill']","WASHINGTON: In a major breakthrough in the fight against AIDS, scientists claim to have for the first time shown that human stem cells can be genetically engineered to seek out and kill HIV-infected cells in a living organism.

The woman from Banapur area of Khurda district said she and her 28-year-old husband had undergone HIV test in the hospital on April 11. ""While he tested negative, I was found positive. He left me and our daughter in the hospital after that. He is not even attending to my phone calls,"" she said.

The woman and her husband, who works as a wall painter in Bangalore, had come to the hospital because of their daughter's illness on April 10. The child had developed intermittent fever and lost weight.

Doctors in Capital Hospital suggested an HIV test on her. The integrated counseling and testing centre (ICTC) in the hospital, however, advised the parents to undergo the test since the girl was too small. After the ICTC revealed the results, the man abandoned the mother and the daughter. The girl is recuperating in the pediatric ward while her mother is attending on her.

""I waited for two days but he did not turn up. I called up my mother and brother after that,"" she said. ""I am shocked because he is otherwise a dotting husband and took care of us very well.""

The woman's brother said when he and some relatives went to meet her husband, the man hurled abuses at them. When contacted over phone by TOI, the husband said, ""You must be knowing why I did this? I had to leave.""

Capital Hospital authorities described the development as a social problem. ""It is an unfortunate development. There is need for greater awareness so that people don't shy away from owning up a HIV+ kin,"" said hospital's deputy medical superintendent Dr S N Swain.

Family sources said the woman after her delivery in Banapur hospital in November was referred to Khurda district headquarters hospital because of profuse bleeding. There she was transfused with two units of blood, which may be the source of her infection. ""We have raised the issue with the Khurda hospital authorities,"" said Pravasini Pradhan, president of Kalinga Network of Positive People, which works for the welfare of HIV+ persons.

Case 1:

On Friday, 38-year-old Kumar (name changed), jumped into a well at his Ajni home in the wee hours. His body was recovered hours later with his cellphone and a suicide note lying close to the well, which said, 'Nobody's to be blamed for my suicide.""

23-year-old tattoo artist Veer (name changed) recently discovered that he was suffering from AIDS. Unable to cope with his rapidly falling health, the lad just stopped taking medicines and finally committed suicide a few days back.Along with being HIV positive, these two men had another thing in common - both of them were closet gays and hadn't declared their sexuality to their families. So, what needs to be done to contain these suicides in the gay community? We try to find the answers…Film director Onir of films like I AM and My Brother Nikhil fame, who's openly declared his sexuality, says: ""It's the burden of dealing with the dual stigma (of homosexuality and HIV), which proves to be their undoing. Gays won't reveal their sexuality without fear till the time Supreme Court gives a ruling in their favour. Meanwhile, sex education will go a long way in educating them about safe sex. Parents ' support can safeguard them against societal cruelty and mockery, which eggs them on to take the ultimate step. They must not force their kids to get married against their wish. It is enough that their child is happy with a partner of his own choice. This acceptance can lessen such sad incidents!""According to Prince Manvendra Singh , India’s first gay royal to declare his sexuality, being a part of a support group goes a long way in lessening the psychological burden of HIV-inflicted gays. ""If they interact regularly with like-minded people and share their fears, their goals and their woes with other HIV-positive people, they feel much better and stronger from within. But, if they remain closet gays, nobody can help them. There's nobody to hold their hand and wipe their tears when danger signals appear,"" says he.

Speak about it!

Anand Chandrani, the founder president of an NGO dedicated to gays and transgenders, says, ""Kumar couldn't cope up with the fact that he was leading dual life.

Diary of an HIV Positive gay

‘I tried to commit suicide thrice’Sundar (name changed), 25""Two years back, I learnt that I was HIV positive, and tried to commit suicide thrice since then. But, whenever I went to jump into a well, the faces of my parents would come in front of me, and I would step back. My parents are now pressurising me to get married, and I am scared of telling them about my homosexuality, as I’m already trying to cope with my HIV.""‘My mom’s support helps me’Tarun (name changed), 23""I have known for the past four years that I'm HIV positive. Last year, I told my mom about it and she was shocked initially. But now, she's become my biggest support and that helps. Hope, some day I can gather enough guts to tell her about my homosexuality too!""'I'm scared my wife will leave me'Sonu (name changed), 31""I'm married and have a two-year-old daughter too. Barely 15 days back, I learnt about my HIV status and was scared to death. On, the counsellor's advice, I had to tell my wife about it. She wept and threatened to leave me, but finally agreed to stay on. I don't think I will be able to tell her about my homosexuality now because I'm scared that she’ll leave me!""","['hiv', 'positive', 'homosexuality', 'hivpositive', 'changed', 'suicide', 'tell', 'rampant', 'support', 'sexuality', 'scared', 'gays']","On Friday, an HIV-positive gay committed suicide, which was second such death in April.

""I have lived my life. But my child is about to bloom. After all relatives having washed their hands of her care, I don't know how she will live and who will power her dreams and shape her future."" The state of children living with HIV/AIDS (CLHA) is growing grim, with more than 400 such children waiting for someone to make their lives a bit easier.

Ragini is passionate about dancing and whenever the song 'Ata jau dya na ghari' is played, her legs just begin to tap and she loses herself in the music. ""I go to school at Nashik Road. I don't remember my mother, who died when I was one. My father died when I was nine. I know I have the disease, but also know that I can fight it,"" said Ragini.

Similar is the fate of 12-year-old visually impaired CLHA, Ankush, who lives in a slum in Satpur. Ankush loves to play the keyboard and other instruments. He lost his father three years back to AIDS and his mother Sangeeta, also HIV positive, is terminally ill. Sangeeta hopes that the government will raise some shelter system for such children. ""Having acquired AIDS from their spouse, women are the worst hit. They lose their husband, their own life and also are unable to see their kids living happily. At least if there is an arrangement for the well-being of the kids, we can be at peace,"" Sangeeta said.

The government, on its own part, cannot allow any such facility, as this would mean discriminating against the ill-fated children, who are the victims in this whole vicious circle. ""The government has no scheme to promote a separate facility for HIV positive persons as it would amount to discrimination,"" said a senior official from the health department, adding that instead, the government was ready to fund all the medical aid required by the patients.

But such means are found insufficient when it comes to the lives of CLHA, once their parents or grandparents pass away. Mahindra and Mahindra along with Yash Foundation has started an HIV/AIDS awareness programme and is working on the rehabilitation of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) and support to CLHAs. ""For the last three years, we have been providing nutritional support to more than 150 CLHAs, monitoring their health and even giving them medical support whenever required. But unfortunately, we do not have a residential system for the children,"" said Jitendra Patil, rehabilitation manager, Yash Foundation.

This is the time when the need of such arrangement is required the most. In the field of medical inventions, medicos have found solutions such that even HIV-positive parents can give birth to a normal child. ""The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) could serve the purpose by raising an 'educational hostel' facility for the short span of twenty years from today. Here, even normal children could also be admitted. The children could go home during the weekends,"" Patil suggested.

Exhibition with a cause

Mahindra and Mahindra, along with Yash Foundation is trying to raise funds to help reach more number of CLHAs in the district. In one such drive, they had organized a 'Taarein Zameen Par' programme on January 26, where renowned artists Shivaji Tupe, Anand Sonar and Dnyanesh Belekar from Nashik, with students from the Arts stream created a large number of paintings, which have now been put for auction from April 30 to May 2 at Sadhana Art Gallery, Deepali Nagar, from 11am to 8pm.

""We aim to raise funds for the CLHAs in such a way that we reach the most number of CLHAs in the district,"" Patil said.

Speaking as chief guest on the International AIDS Candlelight Memorial observation here on Sunday, he lauded the role played by HIV positive people and drug users in leading the struggle for protection of rights and decreasing the spread of the HIV epidemic.

Manipur is one of the six states in the country with widespread prevalence of HIV/AIDS.

Drawing the attention of the MACS project director to the unfinished task of revising the state AIDS policy, legislator I Ibohanbi Singh said policies are a must for tackling issues like HIV and AIDS.

""The draft state AIDS policy needs to be tabled at the earliest and discussed threadbare so that our response to the epidemic is in tune with the needs of the community.

This has come to light with the proper functioning of government's HIV test centre in the district.

Although the rise in number of HIV cases is a matter of concern for the common man, the district health department is looking at it in a positive manner. ""This will not only help the HIV positive person to avail better and free treatment but also stop transmission of HIV to others,"" said an official.

In last two years the official figure of HIV positive cases was put at 22. Till 2010, eleven persons, including pregnant women and children, were found to be HIV positive in the tests conducted at the government's Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) run by State AIDS Control Society.

Year-wise detection of HIV positive cases in the district for last three years on an average stands at five. The ICTC was opened in Lohardaga in 2008. Only one one HIV positive case was detected that year. Later detection of HIV positive cases increased. While in 2009 three such cases were detected. The number increased to seven in 2010, five were detected in 2011 and sixes cases have been detected so far in 2012, thereby, taking the total number since 2008 to 22.

ICTC counsellor Archna Prasad, however, is not satisfied with the number of detection of HIV positive cases in the district. According to Prasad, many more persons suffer the disease but hesitate to come to the ICTC located at the Lohardaga Sadar Hospital for tests and counseling.

""Since my centre maintains everything one needs, trust is necessary. Although people are coming for HIV tests, we still have miles to go with regard to bringing about awareness among the people and removing reservation of those affected by HIV but keeping away from the ICTC. Migration is the source of the disease and this is a major problem as it is difficult to counsel, conduct tests and offer treatment to the affected persons who live outside the state. At most times we ask relatives to encourage their family members to go for testing at their nearest ICTC where they live,"" Prasad said.

The absence of anti retro-viral therapy (ART) centre in the district is creating a problem. A 32-year-old woman found with HIV positive recently has still not started medication as she cannot travel alone. ""She is waiting for her husband, who works in Mumbai, to return.

Student volunteer Max Silva, a senior in anthropology at University of Arizona, said he signed on for the programme because he wanted to do something different and help the HIV community.“At first I thought it would be tough to teach children in Chennai and that language would be a barrier,” said Silva, one of the 19 American student-volunteers in the city this year. “But, man, we are having a blast!

CBI probe has been ordered for the first time by the HC while acting on a PIL.

When the kids were found infected with HIV last year, parents and lawyers from the HC filed PIL demanding a thorough probe. The state government did not even register an FIR against erring officials. The court asked IPS officer Shobha Bhutada to probe the case, but the judges expressed disappointment at her efforts.

Transferring the probe to the CBI, the bench of acting Chief Justice Bhaskar Bhattachayra and Justice J B Pardiwala criticized Bhutada's probe and highlighted her inaction and blunders in its judgment. The judges were shocked at Bhutada's recording statement of local BJP MLA Mahendra Mashroo on the letterhead of a private blood bank, Sarvodaya Blood Bank, which faces charge of being criminally negligent in blood transfusion.

Emphasizing on inaction on part of the IPS officer, the court noted that allegations were against high level officers and the legislator, who illegally occupied space in the government hospital and he being chairman of the blood bank invaded into government's official site and all top officials were blissfully ignorant about this.

The court said that the administration saw to it that probe did not take place in proper manner, as the government was even reluctant to register an FIR. The court observed that no effective steps were taken during five months of probe and the system seemed supporting the private blood bank, which did not even have a license.

The court rejected all contentions raised by the state government.

Paul Sax from Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, lead author of the first study, said, ""Our results provide an additional highly potent, well-tolerated treatment option and highlight the simplicity of treatment resulting from combining several antiretrovirals in a single pill.""Sax said studies have shown that single pill treatments improve both adherence and patient satisfaction and help prevent prescription errors, helping reducing the likelihood of treatment failure and drug resistance.The first trial randomly assigned 700 patients from centres across North America to start treatment with two different single tablet regimens — either Quad, combining the new integrase inhibitor elvitegravir (EVG) boosted with cobicistat (a new pharmacoenhancer COBI) plus FTC/TDF, or a gold standard regimen approved by the FDA in 2006, combining EFV/FTC/TDF (also known as Atripla).After 48 weeks of treatment, 88% of patients given Quad suppressed viral loads to undetectable levels (less than 50 copies per mL of blood), compared with 84% in the EFV/FTC/TDF group.Adverse events that led to patients discontinuing treatment were infrequent and similar in both groups.Mild nausea was more common with Quad, but patients were less likely to have dizziness, abnormal dreams, insomnia, and rash compared with the EFV/FTC/TDF regimen.The second trial included 708 treatment-naïve adults from 146 medical centres across Australia, Europe, North America and Thailand.

A conference was arranged in Delhi with a panel of doctors, mostly gynaecologists or oncologists.The vaccination, which protects you from the deadly HPV virus that leads to cancer, was discussed. The initiative is called ‘Guard your Angel’. In this case, the angels are your daughters, who can get immunised after the age of nine. Although the vaccine is most effective on young girls before their ‘sexual debut’, the doctors said it could be effective right until the age of 45. Now that is something most women don’t know. The doctors answered many questions clearing the doubts of about a hundred women in the audience, a largely educated one. I can’t even begin to understand the plight of the uneducated rural women who have no idea about cervical cancer. “Don’t wait for someone to take you to the doctor, whether it is for the vaccination or the yearly screening. Get up and do it yourself,” said the doctors. Statistics show that one out of every four women affected by this kind of cancer is an Indian. It is now a bigger killer than breast cancer.‘Meri beti meri duty’ said the initiative. However, it is also our duty to live for our betis and our whole family. So while you get your daughter vaccinated after she is nine, also get yourself vaccinated if you fall below the age of 45.“Your family needs you and you have to take care of yourself” said Parminder Saini. She is a pediatrician who got affected by cervical cancer. She fought it and is back to leading the life of a doctor. “I want people not to feel sorry for me but want the affected to be inspired to fight this disease and the rest of the world to keep themselves healthy,” she said. She talked about deleting stress from our lives as much as possible, pointing to the fact that it can be one of the main causes of cancer. Practices like yoga and meditation should be a part of daily life. “Eat healthy, focusing on fruits and vegetables,” she said. “Live your life and value it.”So let’s guard our special angels.

India’s National AIDS Control Organization ( NACO ) told TOI that counseling patients before and after they undergo testing is vital.“If patients find themselves HIV positive by testing at home without counseling, it can push them to suffer from severe depression, make them commit suicide or lead to violence if women are found to be positive. Around 35% of all new cases of HIV in India are among women India. Such home testing kits can be allowed in countries with high infection rates in the general population and not in India where the epidemic is concentrated among high risk populations like sex workers,” said national ART officer at NACO Dr B B Rewari.Union health ministry officials said at present nearly 10,000 centres across India counsel people who undertake a HIV test. In 2011, an estimated 1.6 million people got tested for HIV. Around 2.31 million people are estimated to be HIV positive in India.“Of these, 40% don’t know that they are infected. Counseling is vital. We tell those who get tested and are found HIV positive how to lead a healthy life, how we will connect them to care, support and treatment services, put them on nutritional support and prevent further spread of the virus,” Dr Rewari added.Dr Sandhya Kabra from NACO said, whenever a patient is found to be HIV positive, the test is repeated two more times to confirm the results.“If found negative, the test isn’t repeated. But if the test gives a positive result, we repeat the test for extra confirmation. Testing without counseling can make a patient take drastic measures,” Dr Kabra said.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that there are about 50,000 new HIV infections every year. Many of these new infections are transmitted from people who are unaware of their HIV status.Clinical studies for self-testing have shown that the OraQuick In-Home HIV Test has an expected performance of 92% for test sensitivity, the percentage of results that will be positive when HIV is present. This means that one false negative result would be expected out of every 12 test results in HIV-infected individuals.Clinical studies also have shown that the OraQuick In-Home HIV Test has an expected performance of 99.98% for test specificity, the percentage of results that will be negative when HIV is not present.This means that one false positive would be expected out of every 5,000 test results in uninfected individuals.A variety of home tests finger pricks or mouth swabs are now being developed to be used by individuals to know their HIV status by sitting at home which can produce results in one-20 minutes. UNAIDS report recently said the world was opening up to home testing for HIV since fewer than half of those living with HIV knew their status. This is a huge barrier to treatment scale up.“Despite the advances in technology, testing is still approached with fear, accessing clinics is inconvenient and the experience of HIV testing is often stigmatizing. The cost of these tests is now measured in cents,” UNAIDS said.In September, 2011, the United Kingdom’s House of Lords’ select committee on AIDS recommended repealing laws that prohibit home HIV testing.","['hiv', 'positive', 'result', 'testing', 'infected', 'test', 'tested', 'negative', 'results', 'approves', 'india', 'upholds', 'privacy']","Around 2.31 million people are estimated to be HIV positive in India.“Of these, 40% don’t know that they are infected.

339,26-7-2012,['Sumitra Debroy'],https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg,"MUMBAI: An HIV scare looms large over Mumbai as regular supply of condoms, syringes and medicines to tackle the deadly virus has nearly dried up in its most vulnerable pockets. Twenty-one NGOs (non-governmental organizations) and 13 community-based organizations (CBOs) that handle a total of 52 intervention projects for the city’s population at highest risk of contacting and spreading HIV have not received central government funds since April.This blow comes at a time when already close to 60,000 of the 4.20 lakh individuals in the state afflicted with HIV are living in the city. Although its prevalence in the general population has been on a decline, the graph has only been rising for the high-risk groups.The crunch in funds has directly affected efforts made by agencies to protect an estimated 2.34 lakh high-risk individuals. They include female sex workers (FSW), transgender individuals, men having sex with men (MSM), intravenous drug users (IDU), truckers and migrants. Currently, HIV prevalence among FSW is as high as 27%, 18% in IDUs, 12% in MSM and 30% in the transgender population.Following the fund crisis, most NGOs and CBOs have been forced to downsize their workforce and a few have even completely stalled their work. Funds allocated to each project vary from Rs 9 lakh to 20 lakh, depending on its reach. Without the money, most organizations have been unable to pay their staffers, and have defaulted on the rents and electricity bills. The worst hit are some former sex workers-turned-outreach workers and -peer educators, who have had to go back to their old ways to support their families.TOI came across one such outreach worker from Malwani who said she waited for two months for her salary of Rs 7,000 to arrive. “On the third month, I had no choice but to do the only work I knew,” said the worker, who is associated with a CBO that caters to the transgender population. As an outreach worker, her job is to visit brothels to distribute condoms and inform new entrants about prevention.A Ghatkopar-based NGO told TOI that they were struggling to even purchase stationery for daily use while a south Mumbai CBO that works with MSM said they had to take huge loans to meet ends. Eldred Tellis, director of Sankalp Rehabilitation Trust , said he had to borrow approximately Rs 7.5 lakh from his trust’s buffer to sustain three IDU projects. “Though bigger NGOs can sustain for a while, smaller organizations are finding it extremely difficult to cope,” he said.Ashok Row Kavi, founder-chairperson of Humsafar Trust, also said three of his MSM projects were badly hit. “Without paying salaries, how can I expect my volunteers to be present at the site and distribute condoms everyday? This (fund crunch) has created a dent in the measures taken so far and an increase in HIV prevalence is likely,” he said.Dr Balkrishna Adsul, additional project director of Mumbai District Aids Control Society ( MDACS ), said, “The delay was from NACO’s end. But funds have arrived now and we have started disbursing it already.” He also said the crunch at the Centre could be caused by the drying up of money from global agencies. Geneva-based Global Fund (GF) had announced stoppage of funds till 2014 for diseases, including HIV, in India.Dr Neeraj Dhingra, deputy director general, NACO, said he would check how and why the crunch happened. “There is sufficient money to fund projects as long as NGOs are clear with their records,” he said.","['hiv', 'ngos', 'projects', 'dry', 'funds', 'lakh', 'fund', 'msm', 'crunch', 'organizations', 'scare', 'mumbai']","MUMBAI: An HIV scare looms large over Mumbai as regular supply of condoms, syringes and medicines to tackle the deadly virus has nearly dried up in its most vulnerable pockets.

People diagnosed with HIV that without treatment develops into AIDS take antiviral medications to control the infection that attacks their immune system.In a statement, the FDA stressed that the drug should be used as part of a ""comprehensive HIV prevention plan"", including condom use and regular HIV testing. Studies show that Truvada reduced the risk of HIV in healthy gay men - and among HIV-negative heterosexual partners of HIV-positive people - by between 44% and 73%.""In the 80s and early 90s, HIV was viewed as a life-threatening disease; in some parts of the world it still is. Medical advances, along with the availability of close to 30 approved individual HIV drugs, have enabled us to treat it as a chronic disease most of the time,"" Debra Birnkrant, director of the Division of Antiviral Products at FDA, said.GM bacteria prevents malaria transmissionIn a breakthrough, US scientists have genetically modified a bacterium to kill the parasite that causes malaria before it infects humans. Researchers at Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute said their breakthrough could help prevent mosquitoes from transmitting malaria to humans. Malaria kills over 800,000 people worldwide every year, most of them are children.In the new study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers modified the bacterium, called Pantoea agglomerans, to secrete proteins that are toxic to the malaria parasite, but not harmful to the mosquito or humans. The bacterium is commonly found in the mosquito's midgut. It was found that the modified bacteria were 98 per cent effective in reducing the malaria parasite burden in the insects, the researchers said.","['hiv', 'pill', 'cut', 'researchers', 'modified', 'humans', 'risk', 'malaria', 'drug', 'fda', 'parasite', 'nod', 'infection', 'onceaday']","WASHINGTON: For the first time, a once-a-day pill which reduces the chance of contracting HIV among high risk groups ""significantly"" has got green signal in the US, where 1.2 million people are infected by the deadly disease.

Earlier this week, the Food and Drug Administration approved a daily pill, Truvada, which reduces the risk of HIV infection.A team of researchers from the University of Nebraska Medical Center is progressing towards developing weekly or twice-monthly injectable antiretroviral therapy (ART) nanomedicines for patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.A long-acting, nanoformulated ART (nanoART) would be a substantive improvement over daily and sometimes more complex regimen of pills , lead investigator on the development of nanoART for HIV/AIDS and professor and chairman of the department of pharmacology and experimental neuroscience (PEN) at UNMC, Howard Gendelman, MD, said.A journal article hails the successful testing of UNMC’s ART injectables as treatment of HIV-infected mice and in preventing new infections.“We actually followed the process exactly as we would with a person – and it worked,” Dr. Gendelman said.“This is all very exciting. Although there are clear pitfalls ahead and the medicines are not yet ready for human use, the progress is undeniable.”Dr. Gendelman said one of the project’s real advantages is in the nanoformulations.“NanoART is cell directed. So when you take a pill, the pill travels throughout the body indiscriminately. In these nanomedicines, you can use the body’s own cells to direct the medicine where you want it to go,” he said.The UNMC project directs the medicine to the monocyte-macrophage, cells which carry the drug particle to sites of the body specifically where HIV grows.“You’re using the cell that is the target for the virus to deliver the drug against the virus,” Dr. Gendelman said.Dr. Gendelman calls the progress made “a Nebraska invention,” as it involved so many of the state’s scientists in different disciplines working together.He said this marks the third article his team has had published in major biomedical journals in recent months with all the articles related to the nanomedicine injectable therapy.The advance to use the new nanomedicines to specifically target reservoirs for viral infection was explained by Georgette Kanmogne , Ph.D., associate professor in PEN, lead investigator, and published in the International Journal of Nanomedicine. This paper describes how these drug inventions can enter the brain and ameliorate nervous system disease.The third study, published in Trends in Neurosciences, is a research area led by Larisa Poluektova, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor in PEN, and the developer of the mouse models of HIV/AIDS used in study.“We work as a team and work effectively as a team with different scientists with very different disciplines involved in different aspects of the work,” Dr. Gendelman said.This research team is made up of two UNMC colleges, four departments and two universities. The drugs were developed in UNMC labs using nanoformulation approaches.The ART tests in mouse models were made possible by UNMC’s development of specially designed mice. Because mice cannot catch human HIV, UNMC has developed mice with the equivalent of a human immune system. Such a mouse model enables advanced tests on HIV and its treatment.Dr. Kanmogne said an ART injection would be an improvement for HIV patients because it would produce all the medicine needed without the complications of remembering to take pills daily, drug toxicities, buildup of viral resistance, intestinal problems, or the social stigma of pills.The work will be presented at the forthcoming meeting for the American Society for Nanomedicine, where Dr. Gendelman will serve as conference chair.The study has been recently published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.","['hiv', 'replace', 'published', 'pill', 'mice', 'daily', 'regimen', 'jab', 'work', 'gendelman', 'art', 'drug', 'team', 'unmc', 'soon']","Researchers are trying to develop an injection that will replace the daily pill regimen for HIV patients.

Fauci, M.D., Director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Bethesda, Md., made the recommendation at a JAMA media briefing at the International AIDS Conference.Among the most important interventions is combination antiretroviral therapy, which significantly improves the health and longevity of individuals infected with HIV.“Since the advent of antiretroviral therapy, the annual number of deaths due to AIDS has decreased by two-thirds in the United States. Globally, an estimated 700,000 lives were saved in 2010 alone due to the increased availability of antiretroviral therapy in low- and middle-income countries,” Dr. Fauci and Gregory K.

Also, antiretroviral therapy is highly effective in blocking mother-to-child HIV transmission.Other important interventions include medical male circumcision, which offers a highly effective and durable way to protect heterosexual men from HIV infection; and potentially, pre-exposure prophylaxis with antiretroviral medications, which have shown promise in reducing an individual''s risk of acquiring HIV infection.“Each of these treatment and prevention strategies has a strong evidence base; with further refinement and scale-up and also when used in combination, they could have an extraordinary effect on decreasing the trajectory of the HIV pandemic,” they said.They said researchers are maintaining focus on 2 key scientific challenges that remain: the development of a vaccine and a cure. They wrote that modest success in a large-scale clinical trial of an HIV vaccine, promising results in animal models, and advances in structure-based vaccine design suggest that an HIV vaccine is feasible.

Delhi health minister AK Walia and K Srinath Reddy, director of the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), among others, were present on the occasion.Menabde said there are five main hepatitis viruses, types A, B, C, D and E, of which B and C are most lethal as they can lead to liver cirrhosis and cancer. She added, “About six lakh people die every year due to the acute or chronic consequences of hepatitis B, nearly 100 times more than HIV/AIDS.”Walia said that both hepatitis B and C spread through contact with the blood of an infected person. It can be through transfusion of infected blood, sharing of contaminated needles or injection material. Hepatitis B can also be transmitted from mother to child. “To check the spread of the disease through blood transfusion, we are going to introduce Nucleic Acid Test ( NAT ) to ensure immediate and accurate screening of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV in donated blood,” Walia said. He added that Delhi is among the first few states to have introduced vaccination for hepatitis B in the universal immunization programme.

The government is mulling to file a review petition in the Orissa high court against the court's July 28, 2011 order asking it to ensure the antigen test using nucleic acid amplification test in polymer chain reaction (NAT PCR) method to identify HIV infection in all blood banks against the ongoing test method called Elisa.

Stating the reasons behind the government's reluctance, State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC) director and convenor of the committee Dr K C Behera said studies show that the accuracy of the costlier NAT PCR test is not significantly higher compared to the Elisa method. ""There were various considerations.

The government is yet to take a final decision. We will again meet the health secretary in this connection,"" Dr Behera said. Despite attempts, health secretary P K Mahapatra could not be contacted for comment.

Sources said the committee in the health department during a recent meeting considered the findings of a Canadian study, which reportedly found that the NAT PCR method would help detect HIV in just one among one million blood units, which may be have been missed in Elisa test. Some members said the result was too insignificant.

A doctor preferring anonymity said the Canadian study may not be relevant for Indian states. Awareness level among blood donors is very high in Canada where majority of blood donors are regulars, eliminating chances of window period due to periodic tests on them before each donation.

Indian studies found detection rates of NAT PCR significantly higher compared to Elisa. A multi-centric Indian study undertaken in various centres including Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research Chandigarh, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences Lucknow and Indraprastha Apollo Hospital New Delhi, published in Indian Journal of Medical Research in 2008, has found that NAT PCR can detect one in 1,500 units of blood, which otherwise remains undetected in Elisa method.

The government's latest U-turn not to adopt NAT PCR comes around six months after another high-level committee on February 25 decided to adopt the test. The 15-member committee under the chairmanship of National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) mission director Pramod Meherda had unanimously recommended the NAT PCR technology for screening of blood to reduce the 'grey zone' period of HIV, hepatitis B and C. The committee had suggested to roll out the test in a phased manner. It had recommend forming of another seven-member committee to decide on the modalities of the test like whether to invite expression of interest and funding pattern. However, the second committee favoured not to go for the test at all.

The test, if introduced in six nodal blood banks across the state, would cover around Rs 11 crore to test over 1.81 lakh units of blood in a year. Sources said the automated NAT PCR machine is available at a cost of around Rs 3 crore.

Blood banks, however, favour introduction of NAT PCR. ""It is definitely a better method that significantly reduces the window period of HIV. We would like to introduce the test in all our blood banks if the government gives financial support,"" said Indian Red Cross state branch honorary secretary Mangala Mohanty. Of the 81 blood banks in Odisha, 56 are being run by the Red Cross.

The HC bench of Chief Justice V Gopala Gowda and Justice B N Mahapatra had passed the order for a mandatory PCR test while adjudicating on the petition of a resident of Badamba in Cuttack district. The petitioner's son was transfused blood collected from a Red Cross blood bank in Municipal Hospital in Bhubaneswar before a surgery at Neelachal Hospital when he was 10 months old. He had tested positive for HIV at the age of 17 months.","['hiv', 'blood', 'pcr', 'indian', 'banks', 'test', 'method', 'health', 'nat', 'undecided', 'committee']","BHUBANESWAR: A high-level government committee is against introduction of a more accurate test to detect HIV in blood banks.

Andhra Pradesh, which accounts for 5 lakh of the 24 lakh HIV positive in the country, remains the state with the most number of HIV-infected people, official statistics show.Government and private initiatives have helped reduce the number of people infected each year in the state, said officials of Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TNSACS). “Around 27,000 people tested positive for HIV in the state in 2009,” said a TNSACS official. “In 2010, the number dropped to 23,000, and in 2011, it fell further to 20,000. That’s a decrease of 7,000 new cases in two years.”Activists attribute the success of the state’s AIDS programme to the commitment of the health sector and the government. “Tamil Nadu was the first state to start an autonomous AIDS control society and the model, backed by political will, has been very successful,” said Dr R Lakshmibai of Tamil Nadu Aids Initiative. “National AIDS Control Organisation has recommended the model to other states.”The state has benefitted from specialized target intervention programmes that go beyond focusing on vulnerable groups such as sex workers, said M Ramar of Centre for Social Development and Social Work Research in Coimbatore who runs intervention programs for migrant workers.“Once we started targeting their clients, which spans various groups like migrant workers, truckers and youngsters, things started looking better,” Ramar said. “I see a sense of awareness among migrant workers here. Fewer migrant workers than before are testing positive each year. Red ribbon clubs are also doing good work at college level.”According to Dr Lakshmibai, intervention programmes prevented the disease from reaching generalised epidemic proportions. “There are three levels — nascent epidemic, concentrated epidemic and generalised epidemic,” she said. “The state never let it reach the generalised stage. When it looked like our intervention programs were only creating awareness and not changing behaviour, the state brought in specialised programmes.”Andhra Pradesh, on the other hand, shut down 266 of its first-level detection and counselling centres due to a cash crunch. However, Dr Lakshmibai added that although Tamil Nadu is doing well, sustaining the effort to reduce the incidence of new cases will be a challenge. “Trends and sexual behaviour keeps changing,” she said. “Agencies have to keep track of all developments while designing preventive programmes.”The state also has its work cut out in its intervention programme for transgenders. “The first survey was done only recently and shows that 9% of transgenders in the state are HIV-positive, a higher ratio than the 6% of female sex workers,” Dr Lakshmibai said.","['hiv', 'nadu', 'fewer', 'aids', 'tn', 'migrant', 'numbers', '5th', 'number', 'workers', 'lakshmibai', 'intervention', 'lakh', 'state', 'cases', 'tamil']","“Tamil Nadu was the first state to start an autonomous AIDS control society and the model, backed by political will, has been very successful,” said Dr R Lakshmibai of Tamil Nadu Aids Initiative.

The condition of children living with HIV (CLHIV) is still worse with not many paediatricians versed with care required for these children.

These were amongst the few grievances expressed by HIV positive people during the three-day grassroots level advocacy workshop organized by NGO World Vision India. Forty PLHIVs and many other NGOs participated. NGOs working in the field of HIV/AIDS like Sanjeevan, District Level PLHA Network, Eficor, Saathii, CRTDP, IID, Women Resource Center, Sharansthan, National Council of Churches in India also participated.

""The workshop aimed to strengthen the advocacy capacity of communities to address the issues faced by women and children living with HIV in different areas of the district. We wanted the PLHIVs to get the attention they deserve from the policymakers, the media, and society,"" said Joe George, programme officer of World Vision Nagpur.

The participants discussed several practical difficulties faced by them every day. ""There are no facilities for AIDS patients at village level. With the government deciding to link us with the NRHM workers, this may change. For children suffering from the disease, it would make a huge difference if government provided them nutrition,"" said Anil Dalve, president of Network for PLHIV in Maharashtra.

""The number of ART centres in the state is insufficient if we consider the fact that Maharashtra has 14% of the Indians with the disease. All these people will soon require second line treatment too. I hope the government plans to open more centres,"" said Dalve.

Daisy David, a PLHIV who now works as an advocacy associate, believes the government has good structure but what they lack is implementation and monitoring. ""When the district programme officers for AIDS speak to the NGOs working at the grassroots, they discuss projects and funds but rarely issues. They can't travel to all the villages under their jurisdiction and are unaware of the shortcomings in medical services in many of them,"" she said. If these authorities could guide and help the PLHIVs, things could improve a lot, she said.

""The vaccine showed encouraging results during animal trial stages. The toxicology has been done. I am hopeful, the clinical trial will begin by next year,"" Dr Katoch said. He was in city to attend a meeting of the ICMR tribal health research forum at Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC) in the city.

A research team at the National HIV Reference Centre in AIIMS has developed the HIV-1 DNA vaccine. During animal trials in 1996, the vaccine gave immunity to mice and monkeys from HIV sub-type C, which constitute over 95 per cent of HIV infections in India. The vaccine research had faced problems in 2002 as activists staged protest against use of animals in the tests following which trials on monkeys were then shifted to IISc Bangalore.

The research had come to a stop after retirement of the developer of the vaccine, Dr Pradeep Seth, from AIIMS earlier this year. Dr Seth had headed the microbiology department of the premier institute. ""ICMR has revived the efforts and all clearance will be hopefully in place by this year,"" he said.

Dr Katoch said attempts were made in the country earlier also to develop HIV vaccines. However, two earlier vaccines for HIV were found to have limitations. The one developed by Dr Pradeep Seth in AIIMS is being regarded very promising and may bring paradigm shift in the HIV prevention strategy in future, Dr Katoch said.

He said vaccine making is not a priority of ICMR, which is being looked after by the department of biotechnology. However, ICMR is trying its best to facilitate development of certain vaccines such as the one for HIV, which has big relevance for India, he said.","['likely', 'hiv', 'research', 'vaccine', 'human', 'icmr', 'seth', 'vaccines', 'trial', 'trials', 'dr', 'aiims', 'katoch']","BHUBANESWAR: The human trial of an HIV vaccine, which is being developed by AIIMS, New Delhi, is likely to start as early as 2013, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) director general Dr V M Katoch said here on Thursday.

359,8-9-2012,['Payal Gwalani'],https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg,"NAGPUR: Some of the Western countries are seeing the trend of 'graying' of the HIV infection, with many of the sufferers of the disease surviving upto a ripe age. Ironically, India still seems to be grappling with problems of what some call 'an invisible population group' - Children Living with HIV (CLHIV).

With insufficient government facilities for them, these children have become the first casualties of the drying up of funds being forwarded towards HIV affected people, nationally and internationally. Along with the social and psychological trauma that these kids have to go through, the physical troubles they suffer also multiply in the absence of medical services for them. Most of the NGOs who were working for this deprived lot have either phased out or are in the process of phasing out their projects. Last year, National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) withdrew financial support from many social outfits associated with the cause.

""A very few doctors understand the need of HIV-infected children. and so provide care to them.

Despite being innocent recipients of the virus for no fault of their own, these children are forced to live a life full of despair and denial,"" said Samir Shinde, who has been working since the last few years to improve the condition of CLHIV. He also says that the facilities for screening and check-up of these children are insufficient. ""There is no focused government or NGO programme for the kids. Even the Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) medicine dosages are too strong for most children, which is a reason for other health problems,"" he added.

Madhuri Giri, project coordinator for Sanjeevan, another NGO working for the positive people, said that efforts made by activists end up wasted because of changing government authorities. ""We have discussed the issues with many officials but they get transferred before they can act on the suggestions. In terms of government schemes, these children come under ICDS, where too there is no special mention of their special health and nutritional needs,"" she said. Pointing out that organizations will only help the kids till they have the project or the money, Giri underlined the need for a government project towards this end.

Lack of medical facilities for the children is amongst is another big hurdle, believes social worker Manohar Roy from Eastern Studies Society. ""There is no paediatrician trained to deal with the other infections that afflict these kids because of their weaker immunity. As opposed to this, the facilities for the elders are a little better and improving. This is simply because a Person Living with HIV (PLHIV) is a part of the vote bank, children are not,"" he said. If the dos and don'ts are explained to these kids properly, it is possible for them to be a part of the society, he said while explaining the need for emotional, psychological and medical counselling for the kids.

Director of India Peace Centre John Chelladurai agrees and adds, ""To an extent, some facilities are still there in urban and district centres but not in smaller towns and villages. We can't keep blaming the government as society also needs to be more proactive."" Education may have become the right of every child, but not many schools readily accept children having AIDS, said Harshan KY of Eficor. ""Most of these children become orphans early with nobody to take care of them. From the government's side, all they get is ART treatment, but no nutritional support that can help them have stronger immunity,"" he said.

Support Suggestions

Focused programme aimed to improve the condition of Children Living with HIV (CLHIV)

At least one doctor of each discipline in every city should be trained to handle these children

Private schools can also take up at least one positive child each

Dosage of medicines be made suitable for children

Providing facilities like institutional care, palliative care and immunization for the children

Nutritional support, in the form of health supplements like vitamins, along with ART provided by government

Making care takers aware of the special immunization schedules for CLHIVs

Counseling of High Risk Groups to limit the number of children who are born with the infection

City NGOs' 24x7 care centre for +ve kids

Looking at the dismal way of life Children Living with HIV (CLHIV) are forced to live in the country, some city NGO's decided to change the scenario. Having completed three years of running a day care centre Tehillim Ministries of Charity (TMC), Maharashtra Positive Women's Network and National Integration Society, they are now aiming at establishing a centre of excellence for CLHIVs.

They will now be extending the care provided in their centre to be available 24x7. The ever increasing number of children with the disease, most of whom have lost their parents, they say are denied treatment in government establishments and can't afford that provided by private institutions. The centre will also be providing the children counseling and treatment facilities.

""With constant care being very necessary for these kids, we thought of supporting them in every possible way. Also, if the government can not provide something, instead of complaining, we thought of taking up their cause,"" said Jefferey Nelson, president of TMC, while explaining the idea behind the centre of excellence.

Most CHLIVs are either orphan or semi-orphan, so they do not get the constant care they need, said Varsha Gaikwad, president Positive Women's Network. ""They need regular follow-ups for which not many doctors are available. Also, preventive care is more important for them in the absence of which they know the existence of diseases only when it is in the last stage,"" she said. Since the volunteers of these organizations have known most of the kids through the years and know their medical history, they are better equipped to help them, she believes.

President of National Integration Society Achchelal Chauhan believes that the project acquires more importance since the government facilities available earlier do not exist any longer. ""The government provided facilities like Community Care Centre (CCCs) earlier. But that too was shut down a year ago. The children are being provided with medicines by the government, but not the necessary information and emotional support,"" he said.

The state government has also decided to give preference in jobs to people with AIDS, while process is also on to provide pension to them. People with AIDS would also be carried free to and fro the ART centres. All these measures were announced on Thursday when a specially designed train, Red Ribbon Express, entered Bihar via Kishanganj district.

Red Ribbon Express has special audio-visual systems to create awareness about causes of HIV/AIDS. It also has a condom vending machine, a Bihar State Aids Control Society (BSACS) official said. It was flagged off from New Delhi on January 12 this year.

Choubey said there was an urgent need to involve more and more people in creating awareness about AIDS at every level as there is a misconception that it is a contagious disease. It occurs due to unsafe sex, contaminated blood transfusion and from mother to child during pregnancy or breastfeeding, Choubey said, adding involving rural people, particularly youth, in this programme would help create awareness about it. Awareness would also be created at different fairs of the state, including the Sonepur fair, the minister said.

There are around 12,000 people with AIDS in Bihar, while another 50,000 are HIV +. The largest number of HIV+ people are in Patna district.

These antibodies are capable of stopping the HIV virus from entering blood cells and replicating , thereby arresting an HIV-infected person's progression to AIDS. (An antibody is an infection-fighting protein produced by our immune system when it detects harmful substances like viruses and bacteria.)Called Protocol G, the global project to identify bNabs was started in 2006 by the International Aids Vaccine Initiative (IAVI). So far, blood samples of 1,800 such HIV patients have been screened across 12 countries and 19 bNAbs identified. Margaret McGlynn , IAVI president told TOI that these special antibodies hold vital clues to the design of an effective AIDS vaccine that has eluded scientists so far.The Chennai-based Solomon is busy identifying a rare tribe of HIV-infected patients from across India who've been healthy for years without requiring life-saving anti-retroviral treatment (ART). These people are called ""elite controllers"" . ""The goal is to isolate antibodies that are broadly effective against Clade C subtype of HIV, which predominates in India,"" McGlynn added.The blood samples collected are sent to the all-new Translational Health Sciences and Technology Institute (THSTI) in Gurgaon where scientists will isolate antibodies for testing and see if any of them can stop a variety of HIV subtypes from infecting their target cells.Solomon, who works at YR Gaitonde Center for AIDS Research and Education (YRG CARE) said, ""Only a minority of people who are infected with HIV produce bNAbs. Although HIV is a wildly mutable virus, certain parts of it are relatively resistant to change. These are essential to the virus's ability to infect, and they are the elements of HIV that bNAbs target.""Till now, blood samples from 39 elite controllers have been collected. ""We look for patients who've been infected for over four years but have not required ART. We estimate that of 100 such people, 20% would contain a bNab. We are collecting their blood samples and isolating cells that produce the bNab.""Solomon's team aims to collect samples from 200 elite controllers. ""If IAVI manages to isolate a bNab from any of these blood samples, we will call the patient back and collect 200 ml of blood from him or her over a period of six months. We will then prepare more bNabs from it and try to develop a vaccine,"" she says.IAVI India chief Rajat Goyal says these antibodies could ultimately reveal the Achilles' heel of the virus and help create the HIV vaccine . Experts at the THSTI will look at how the bNab binds to the virus. This will tell scientists which part of the virus the vaccine should target. ""The idea is to create artificially synthesized mimics of their targets on HIV, to be used in vaccines to elicit similar actions and teach the immune system how to thwart HIV infection,"" experts said.""With 7,100 people contracting HIV every day, effective tools to prevent infection are indispensable in the fight against HIV. A broadlyeffective AIDS vaccine would be a powerful asset,"" said M K Bhan, secretary of the department of biotechnology.No bNabs have yet been isolated in the India programme . But it's early days yet, said McGlynn. ""Serum samples collected will first be analyzed for their breadth of neutralization of HIV - in other words, the variety of HIV strains they can neutralize in laboratory assays. The most broadly neutralizing sera will be further analyzed to isolate and clone the antibodies responsible for that activity.""Those antibodies will then be studied in detail for their biochemistry and, if possible, molecular structures and the structures that each targets on the HIV virus .

NAT PCR is regarded as the most accurate test to identify HIV infection, far more dependable than the Elisa and rapid test kit methods in which HIV may remain undetected for a prolonged window period.

Making the announcement during an adjournment motion discussion in the Odisha assembly, health minister Damodar Rout said the test was quite costly and the government had decided to introduce the test at the three government-run medical colleges and the Capital Hospital in the first phase. It will be introduced at other places in a phased manner, he added.

Admitting that two specific cases of HIV transmission through contaminated blood had come to the government's notice, the minister said, ""The government will take all required steps to ensure people have access to safe blood.""

Rout explained that the window period of HIV non-detection is 89 days in rapid test kits, and 21 days in Elisa method. In case of NAT PCR, the window period is only seven days. The minister further said the government had decided to abolish the rapid test method completely as it had the highest margin of error.

The National AIDS Control Organization and National Blood Transfusion Council have no directives to conduct NAT PCR tests, but countrywide, around 20 blood banks use the method, he informed the house.

Raising the motion earlier, Congress chief whip Prasad Harichandan wanted to know what steps the government had taken in view of the ""increase in instances of infected blood being given by blood banks."" Citing a study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the law maker said the prevalent methods were unsafe.

The ICMR study, undertaken in various centres including the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, and Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, New Delhi, was published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research in 2008. It shows that the NAT PCR method can detect one HIV positive case in every 1,500 blood samples tested negative in the Elisa method.

The test, if introduced in six nodal blood banks across the state, would cost around Rs 11 crore to test over 1.81 lakh units of blood in a year. An automated NAT PCR machine costs around Rs 3 crore.

The Orissa high court, in July 28, 2011, had asked the state government to ensure that the NAT PCR method is used identify HIV infection.

A bench of Chief Justice V Gopala Gowda and Justice B N Mahapatra had passed the order while hearing the petition of a resident of Badamba in Cuttack district. The petitioner's son was transfused blood collected from Red Cross Blood Bank in Municipal Hospital in Bhubaneswar before a surgery at Neelachal Hospital when he was 10-month old. He tested positive for HIV at the age of 17 months.","['hospital', 'hiv', 'medical', 'blood', 'pcr', 'window', 'test', 'detect', 'nucleic', 'introduce', 'method', 'nat', 'govt', 'state', 'acid', 'infection']","BHUBANESWAR: After much dithering, the state government on Saturday said it would soon introduce the nucleic acid amplification test in polymer chain reaction (NAT PCR) method for screening blood before transfusion.

She added that the department had already sought opinions from NGOs working for the welfare of HIV patients and the UNICEF among others in this context.

Department officials said that the minister also had plans to convene a meeting of stakeholders in the next few days to discuss the pros and the cons of the move.

The move will require amendment to provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and other allied Acts.

The move is aimed at saving the predicament of individuals who become AIDS victims because of their partners. A pre-marriage test would act as a preventive measure, the official said.

The bone of contention that is up for debate is whether making these tests mandatory would ostracize the infected person in his/her community.

The order comes after the guardians of the boy, who was three days old at the time of the operation, filed a complaint against Kalawati Saran Children’s hospital (KSCH), and the HOD of paediatric surgery at Lady Hardinge Medical College & KSCH, Dr Ajay Kumar.



Noting that the minor contracted a serious disease due to which he cannot survive long, the Commission has awarded Rs 10 lakh as compensation for “mental agony,” “harassment,” and litigation charges. The boy’s parents had asked for a compensation of Rs 22 lakh along with Rs 30,000 as litigation expenses.



The Commission referred the matter to the medical board of Maulana Azad Medical College, which said, “It was incumbent on the part of the doctor who transfused the blood to a patient, screening for HIV should have been done.” There was nothing on record to show how the doctor came to the conclusion that the blood was not contaminated, said the order.



The Commission was also shocked at the doctor’s defence that the blood was tested at the blood bank and had no HIV infection. “It is very strange that Dr Ajay Kumar has not filed any affidavit to show that such a test was conducted by the blood bank,” stated the order.



Taking note of the evidence on record, the order said, the patient had an ailment called FUC-Diaphragmatic for which he was operated on June 12, 1998. It is on account of medical negligence that the minor has HIV.



“The transfusion of the blood to the patient is not in dispute. Obviously, there is sheer medical negligence on the part of opposing parties in not examining the blood and ensuring that it does not contain any HIV infection,” stated the order passed by Commission members VK Gupta and Salma Noor.The Commission also took into account that the child could not have inherited the ailment from his parents since there were “ample documents” to show that the parents did not have HIV infection in their blood.In the complaint the guardians stated that on June 12, 1998, a three-day-old baby was admitted to the children’s hospital for a FUC-Diaphragmatic surgery . The parents were asked to release 1.5 ml of blood for the surgery. After the surgery , the child was discharged . However, the minor was again admitted to the hospital in August 1998 with the same problem along with a Mal rotation Adhesive Intestinal Obstruction due to which the child was not accepting feed.

ALLAHABAD: Following Allahabad being termed by National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) biggest host of HIV/Aids-infected persons in Uttar Pradesh, officials of the UP State Aids Control Society (UPSACS) are working at a breakneck pace to collect block level data (BLD) to ascertain the exact figure of HIV/AIDS patients.

The NACO has placed five UP districts, including Allahabad, Azamgarh, Deoria, Etawah and Banda under its scanner after these districts were placed under sensitive category in migration of HIV/AIDS infected persons.

Allahabad being termed most sensitive, greater stress is being laid on collecting actual data of victims from all 20 blocks of the district and offering treatment and counseling to patients.

UPSACS officials of are carrying out an intensive drive to check the health status of migrants and identify their locations with an aim to offer them counseling and treatment as well as assistance. They are also conducting studies regarding the migration pattern and prevalence of HIV..

Nodal officer, District Aids Programme Control Unit ( DAPCU), Dr O P Shahi told TOI that migrant labourers, truckers and MSM (men having sex with men) were being identified in the district as they were most responsible for and vulnerable to spread of the deadly disease. He added that efforts were underway to identify them so that they could be offered best possible treatment and counselling. During surveys, it has come to notice that victims due to various reasons including social stigma, do not come forward and reel under depression, said Dr Shahi.

Three kinds of migrants are primarily responsible for the spread of the deadly disease including workers at brick kilns, stone cutting, mining, silica mining centres and service clusters (who migrate from one state to another for employment. Dr Shahi said under the directives of NACO and UPACS, district health authorities are busy locating the infected persons with the aim of offering them treatment, assistance and counseling.

UPSACS officials have also been spreading awareness under the information, education and communication (IEC) programme.

Last year, a NACO monitoring committee visited the city to find reasons behind the rapid increase in transmission of HIV in the district. The team had also inspected services being offered to HIV+ and AIDS patients at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC).

The NACO initiative comes in the wake of Allahabad being placed under the high risk group as far as spread of HIV is concerned.

Dr Shahi informed that the villages prone to high risk have been put under the scanner and a series of awareness and educational camps are being launched to check the menace.

Pointedly, NACO has also asked UPSACS to check the status of migrants living in these villages as they are among prime carriers of HIV in the district.

As far as route of infection and risk transmission categories are concerned, in about 85.3 per cent cases the disease spreads due to unsafe sexual contact, while 3.80 per cent, 2.05 per cent, 3.34 per cent and 6.46 per cent cases are due to prenatal transmission, blood transfusion, injectable drug users and others, respectively.

Currently, three NGOs are implementing the targeted interventions among the high risk groups in the district covering commercial female sex workers (FSWs), men having sex with men (MSM) and Intravenous drug users.","['hiv', 'aids', 'momentum', 'census', 'naco', 'sex', 'migrants', 'spread', 'risk', 'cent', 'men', 'jarkhand', 'district', 'treatment', 'gains']","He added that efforts were underway to identify them so that they could be offered best possible treatment and counselling.

Lead scientist from University of Melbourne Marit Kramski found that when pregnant cows were vaccinated with an HIV protein, the first milk produced by the cow after giving birth, called colostrum, produced high antibodies to protect its newborn against disease.



Researchers were now planning to test the effectiveness and safety of the milk before turning it into a cream which will hopefully allow women to protect themselves against contracting the virus during sex, without relying on men, the Herald Sun reported.



However, the final result could be a decade off. The researchers were able to inhibit the virus from infecting cells when combing the virus cells with milk.



""We think the antibodies bind to the surface of the virus and blocks the protein which needs to be freed to get in contact with human cells - like a key and lock system. If the key's not accessible or you change the key, you can't open the door,"" Kramski said adding ""It's a very cheap and easy way to produce a lot of antibodies.""

Imagine the smell of delicacies and hit numbers from Bollywood flicks filling the air when you're surviving on IV drops. And imagine screams of ""aschhe bochhor abar hobe"" from the immersion procession making you think whether you can endure the pain for another year.

What makes you shudder even in your imagination is the life of a group of patients undergoing treatment at the School of Tropical Medicine, which primarily treats HIV cases. Most of them don't hope to do what everyone does on Puja days any more as they're fighting a losing battle against the killer disease.

""So what they cannot step out, we can always step in,"" thought D Ashis, general secretary of Medical Bank. Thus began a unique initiative in which the organization started carrying the spirit of Durga Puja on the hospital campus. On the occasion of Panchami on Friday, doctors, attendants and members of the group shared some light moments with the patients to lessen their burden of pain. Sarees, dhotis and sweets were also distributed to bring a feeling of newness to their otherwise agonizing lives.

""With so many people caring for us, I feel like living again. Otherwise, the way we - the HIV patients - have been stigmatized makes me feel like a burden on the society,"" said Asmina Begumwith pain creased all over her face.

Parmeet Singh, another HIV patient in the male ward, echoed: ""I've been destined to go through the pain, so there's no point complaining. But it really hurts when I think of how I spent the last Puja and what's in store this time. I've learnt that life doesn't give a second chance,"" he regretted.

For Anima, however, it's a relief to be in the hospital. Since she was diagnosed with HIV virus, not a single day passed when her in-laws didn't abuse her. ""For me, spending a single fun-filled day in the hospital is better than four traumatic days at home during Durga Puja,"" she sighed.

""We need to treat the fear before we cure the disease. Life for these people wouldn't have been so miserable had the society been a little sympatheticto them. I feel such an initiative will act as an eye-opener for those whose feel HIV patients should be shunted out of our lives,"" said PK Guha, the hospital superintendent.

Researchers from the Imperial College London claim that their visual sensor technology is ten times more sensitive than the current gold standard methods for measuring biomarkers.

These indicate the onset of diseases such as prostate cancer and infection by viruses including HIV. The colour of a liquid changes to give either a positive or negative result. Researchers say their sensor would benefit countries where sophisticated detection equipment is scarce, enabling cheaper and simpler detection and treatments for patients.

The team tested the effectiveness of the sensor by detecting a biomarker called p24 in blood samples, which indicates HIV infection. ""Unfortunately, the existing gold standard detection methods can be too expensive to be implemented in parts of the world where resources are scarce,"" Professor Molly Stevens, from the Departments of Materials and Bioengineering, said.

""Our approach affords for improved sensitivity, does not require sophisticated instrumentation and it is ten times cheaper, which could allow more tests to be performed for better screening of many diseases,"" said Stevens.

Pradip, who is undergoing Anti-Retroviral Therapy (Art), is competing at the eighth Senior Mr Asia championship in Ludhiana in the first week of November. The next month, he will take part in the 4th Mr World Championship in Bangkok.

A resident of Khamnam Leirak in Imphal West, Pradip (43) disclosed his health status to the media a few days after bagging the 60-kg category senior 'Mr Manipur' title in a state-level competition held here in December, 2007. Pradip, a brand ambassador of Manipur Aids Control Society (Macs), later bagged silver and bronze medals in different national competitions and stood eighth in the 'Mr World' competition.

Manipur is one of the six high HIV/AIDS prevalence states of the country. According to Macs, the state has 38,016 people infected with HIV, including 10,109 women and 2,578 children. Pradip, who has emerged as an icon of inspiration to the world, spends around Rs 40,000 in procuring foreign nutritional diet every month.

""Macs, which used to pay Rs 8,000 a month for my nutritional support, has stopped extending the amount since June this year,"" Pradip informed TOI on Monday.

""The state government which had promised to appoint me as a regular employee in the youth affairs and sports department in 2009 also failed to do anything about it. This was another major setback,"" said Pradip. A group of HIV positive widows of the state launched a charity campaign to collect money for him after they came to know about his financial condition. They are providing me monetary help and I am very thankful to them, he said.

Recently, a social organization donated Rs 1.5 lakh to the bodybuilder for his cause, he said.

I was a little scared in the beginning, but I made a lot of new friends,” she said coyly.Maya is among the 34 residents of a children’s home in Bandikavanur village, about 30km from Chennai, who stepped into a school for the first time on Wednesday after HIV played havoc in their lives. They are all children of HIV+ve people.While most of them have lost either or both of their parents, 19 of them inherited the virus. The children — 18 girls and 16 boys — were admitted to a primary school in the village in Thiruvallur district under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan’s ‘Education for all’ scheme.For most of these children, the scheme gave them their first shot at leading a “normal” life. “I’ve often stood by the gate of the children’s home and watched school kids in uniforms jostle with one another. I wished I could join them and be their friend, but I wasn’t sure if they would accept me. Today, I finally got a chance to be a student,” said 10-year-old Mani*, who lost both his parents to HIV.The 34 children, from across the state, are currently under the care of the Community Health Education Society (CHES), which has a home in the village that houses 85 HIV infected and affected children. Most of them find schooling difficult because of opposition from the school authorities and other parents who know about their health status.Bandikavanur Panchayat Union Primary school principal N Shanthi said it wasn’t easy admitting these children. “In the beginning, we had decided not to reveal the children’s background, but word soon got around and we had parents approaching us asking if their wards would get infected. Explaining the situation wasn’t easy, but the panchayat head and elders in the village got together and explained things to them,” she said. The school also made provisions to cater to the medical needs of the children and the teachers are being trained to handle emergencies.For CHES, it marks the end of a 19-year struggle. “For close to two decades, we have been trying to send HIV-affected children to mainstream schools, but few would admit them. Even if they were admitted, the children would drop out as they couldn't bear the discrimination.

In Trichy, the desire for remarriage is growing among widowers. However, very few widows who are HIV positive want to remarry.

According to statistics from the district administration, there are 11,097 people including 6,654 males and 4,443 females who are HIV positive. Most of the women are said to have received the killer syndrome from their husbands.

With a view to finding a suitable life partner for both men and women patients, two marriage information bureaus exclusively for HIV people have been functioning in Trichy for the past six years. The marriage bureaus neither encourage nor discourage marriage. They simply explain to them the merits and demerits of marriage and let the parties decide. On the other hand, the counsellors believe that such marriages might prevent HIV positive men from spreading the virus through affairs.

The two marriage bureaus have so far received about 250 applications seeking life partners. Interestingly, most of the applicants are widowers between 30 and 50. However, the number of widow applicants are nearly 50. Since there is a possibility that babies born to such couples will become HIV-affected, the marriage bureaus counsel the pairs to have safe sex to avoid having children. But the couples seemingly want to have children.

The HIV-affected men want to get married for various social and personal reasons. ""The decision to remarry involves many reasons. First, many widowers do not want to expose themselves by being alone. So, they want to marry to hide their disease. Some of them are forced by their families to get married. There are many persons who want to enter wedlock for marital consummation. Interestingly, a 50-year-old man has now applied for remarriage. Since 2008, we received 39 applications from men and five applications from women. But only 12 marriages have taken place so far and seven children have been born through such marriages. All the children tested HIV negative,"" said A Thamil, a HIV positive person who runs Network for Positive People in Trichy.

Thamil also said, ""Most women are affected by HIV because of their husbands. Many of them have begotten children through their marriage. Unfortunately, the sudden deaths of their husbands put the future of both mother and child at risk. Nevertheless, they do not want to think of remarriage because they do not want to lead a volatile life.""","['hiv', 'positive', 'trichy', 'children', 'walk', 'remarriage', 'widowers', 'hivhit', 'women', 'road', 'tough', 'bureaus', 'men', 'marriage']","However, very few widows who are HIV positive want to remarry.

HIV-related travel restrictions at present exist in 45 countries.The Global AIDS Epidemic 2012 report, released by UNAIDS on Tuesday, says that the effects of such restrictions are severe for migrant workers, who play an increasingly prominent role in the global economy.There is a blanket ban on entry of people living with HIV in five countries — Brunei Darussalam, Oman, Sudan, the UAE and Yemen.Five other countries — Egypt, Singapore, Iraq, Qatar and Turks and Caicos Islands — require individuals wishing to stay for short periods (10–90 days) to prove that they are HIV-negative.Laws in 20 countries, including Malaysia, Russia, Singapore, Jordan and Kuwait, deport individuals discovered to be living with HIV.Even in the epidemic's fourth decade globally, nearly four in 10 countries worldwide still lack any specific legal provisions to prevent or address HIV-related discrimination.The number of international migrants rose from 191 million to 214 million between 2005 and 2010.The report says that the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) – Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE – all mandatorily test people seeking to come to the Gulf countries to work and require them to be periodically tested to renew visas.""Those who become HIV-positive while working in the Gulf are often quarantined, deported, denied appropriate health care and ostracized upon returning to their home countries. Migrants' HIV-positive test results are shared with all approved by the medical centres in the Gulf Cooperation Council, with such workers categorized as ""permanently unfit"" to enter any Gulf Cooperation Council country in the future,"" the report said.India lifted all travel restrictions against HIV-positive patients in 2010.In 2002, the Union health ministry had issued a notification, stating that mandatory test for HIV for India-bound foreign nationals should be removed from visa forms. However, some embassies failed to enforce it, and continued to display the requirement of HIV test certificate on their websites as well as on visa forms.On September 17, 2010, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) clarified that there are no travel or residency restrictions for People Living with HIV (PLHIV) coming to India.UNAIDS says that most of these restrictions were imposed in the early years of the epidemic, when little was understood about HIV prevention and effective HIV treatment did not exist.""In 2012, governments increasingly recognize that these restrictions make no sense in a world in which HIV exists in every country, people living with HIV are living long and productive lives and equal freedom of movement is not only a human right but essential in a globalized world. Of note is the decline in the number of countries, territories and areas with HIV-related travel restrictions from 96 in 2000 to 45 in 2012,"" UNAIDS said.UNAIDS aims to eliminate these restrictions by 2015.Since 2010, Armenia, China, Fiji, Namibia, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of Moldova, Ukraine and the US have repealed such restrictions. Where such restrictions continue to exist, other forms of HIV stigma and discrimination are usually common.The World Health Organization (WHO) pointed out that such entry restrictions mount pressure on people into concealing their HIV infection from immigration authorities.""They simply do not carry their HIV medicines on international trips. This could lead to drug-resistant HIV strains that are transmissible to other people. Besides, drug resistance allows HIV to replicate in the body more freely, people with higher viral loads are also more infectious,"" WHO said.","['hiv', 'affecting', 'restrictions', 'patients', 'bar', 'world', 'test', 'gulf', 'hivrelated', 'countries', 'global', 'travel', 'report', 'living', 'unaids', 'economy']","NEW DELHI: Nearly 25 years after HIV was detected in India, travel restrictions continue to bar patients from free movement through nations.

Globally, 2.5 million people became newly infected with HIV in 2011.Half of all reductions in new HIV infections in the last two years have been among newborn children showing that elimination of new infections in children is possible.In 2011, there were 34 million people living with HIV. In South and south-east Asia, an estimated 4 million people were living with HIV in 2011, compared to 3.7 million in 2001.The same year, new infections in children were 43% lower than in 2003, and 24% lower than 2009. However, 72% of children living with HIV do not have any access to treatment.An estimated 6.8 million people are eligible for treatment, but don't have access.These are the findings of the Global AIDS Epidemic 2012 report released by UNAIDS on Tuesday. The number of people accessing HIV treatment has increased by 63% between 2009 and 2011.In India, however, around 60% people requiring treatment are getting it. ""The pace of progress is quickening — what used to take a decade is now being achieved in 24 months,"" said Michel Sidibé, executive director of UNAIDS. ""We are scaling up faster and smarter than ever before. It is the proof that with political will and follow through we can reach our shared goals by 2015,"" he said.Gains have been made in reducing tuberculosis (TB)-related AIDS deaths in people living with HIV. In the last 24 months, a 13% decrease in TB-related AIDS deaths was observed. This accomplishment is due to record number of people with HIV/TB co-infection accessing antiretroviral treatment, which is recorded at 45%.UNAIDS also estimates that an additional 4 million discordant couples (where one partner is living with HIV) would benefit from HIV treatment to protect their partners from HIV infection.Of the 34 million people living with HIV, about half do not know their HIV status. The report states that if more people knew their status, they could come forward for HIV services.For example, South Africa increased its scale up of HIV treatment by 75% in the last two years—ensuring 1.7 million people had access to the lifesaving treatment—and new HIV infections have fallen by more than 50,000 in only two years.The report shows that a more than 50% reduction in the rate of new HIV infections has been achieved across 25 low and middle-income countries –– more than half in Africa, the region most affected by HIV.In some of the countries which have the highest HIV prevalence in the world, rates of new HIV infections have been cut dramatically since 2001 — by 73% in Malawi, Botswana (71%), Namibia (68%), Zambia (58%), Zimbabwe (50%), South Africa and Swaziland (41%).In addition to welcome results in HIV prevention, sub-Saharan Africa has reduced AIDS-related deaths by one-third in the last six years and increased the number of people on antiretroviral treatment by 59% in the last two years alone.The area where perhaps most progress is being made is in reducing new HIV infections in children. Half of the global reductions in new HIV infections in the last two years have been among newborn children. ""It is becoming evident that achieving zero new HIV infections in children is possible,"" said Sidibé. ""I am excited that far fewer babies are being born with HIV. We are moving from despair to hope,"" he added.The report shows that antiretroviral therapy has emerged as a powerful force for saving lives. In the last 24 months the numbers of people accessing treatment has increased by 63% globally. In sub-Saharan Africa, a record 2.3 million people had access to treatment. China has increased the number of people on HIV treatment by nearly 50% in the last year alone. There were more than half a million fewer deaths in 2011 than in 2005. The largest drops in AIDS-related deaths are being seen in countries where HIV has the strongest grip. South Africa saw (100,000) fewer deaths, Zimbabwe (nearly 90,000), Kenya (71,000) and Ethiopia (48,000) than in 2005.","['records', 'hiv', 'africa', 'children', 'deaths', 'half', 'million', 'infections', '25', 'dip', 'living', 'increased', 'treatment', 'india']","Globally, 2.5 million people became newly infected with HIV in 2011.Half of all reductions in new HIV infections in the last two years have been among newborn children showing that elimination of new infections in children is possible.In 2011, there were 34 million people living with HIV.

The family was evicted from their house on November 6 after a worker of an NGO, Jeevan Aadhar Community Care Centre, made it public to their neighbours that they were HIV positive. The head of the family, a mason, with his pregnant wife and four children where manhandled and thrown out of their house by neighbours. The entire family then shifted to Umaid Hospital as the woman suffered injuries and started bleeding when the neighbours pushed them out of the locality. The neighbours claimed that they would also get infected if the family continued to live there.

Once out of the hospital, the family spent time wandering here and there in the city and finally made railway station their home where they were spotted by a local NGO, Jodhpur Network of People Living with AIDS. ""We initiated the efforts to rehabilitate them and brought the matter to the notice of the administration,"" said Dinesh Joshi of the NGO.

On the interference of district collector Gaurav Goyal, some policemen from the concerned police station who had earlier refused to lent an ear to the woes of the family, went to the locality and warned the neighbours and re-accommodated the family in their house.

Other countries, including Armenia, China, Fiji, Moldova, Namibia and Ukraine have also recently removed such restrictions.“Travel restrictions on individuals with HIV are unnecessary and hinder the ability for individuals and companies to operate in a truly global workforce,” said Mark Bertolini, chairman and CEO of Aetna.Most HIV-travel restrictions were imposed by governments in the 1980s when little was known about the transmission of HIV, and treatment didn’t exist. “Since then, we’ve learned how to effectively prevent, manage and treat HIV,” UNAIDS said.“Restrictions on entry, stay and residence for people living with HIV are discriminatory and a violation of human rights,” said Michel Sidibé, executive director of UNAIDS. “Every individual should have equal access to freedom of movement. I urge all countries to remove all such restrictions based on HIV status,” he added.“HIV travel restrictions are discriminatory and bad for business,” said Chip Bergh, president of Levi Strauss & Co.There is a blanket ban on entry of people living with HIV in five countries — Brunei Darussalam, Oman, Sudan, UAE and Yemen. Five countries -- Egypt, Singapore, Iraq, Qatar and Turks and Caicos Islands -- require individuals wishing to stay for short periods (10–90 days) to prove that they are HIV-negative.Laws in 20 countries including Malaysia, Russia, Singapore, Jordan and Kuwait deport individuals discovered to be living with HIV.Even in the epidemic’s fourth decade globally, nearly 4 in 10 countries worldwide still lack any specific legal provisions to prevent or address HIV-related discrimination.The Global AIDS Epidemic 2012 report, released by UNAIDS, says that the effects of such restrictions are most severe for migrant workers, who play an increasingly prominent role in the global economy. From 2005 to 2010, the number of international migrants rose from 191 million to 214 million.

Earlier, an average of 30-40 per cent of the children born to HIV positive women used to be HIV positive. However, this has reduced to 3 - 4 per cent after PCTP was introduced. Under PCTP, Nevirapine, anti-retroviral (ART) tablets, are given to pregnant women living with HIV. Nevirapine syrup is given to new born babies,"" Dr Kishore said.The Union government has introduced another PCTP to check the transmission of HIV recently, wherein anti-retroviral medicines are administered to HIV positive women from their fourth month of pregnancy, Kishore said adding that the programme is aimed at bringing the parent to children transmission rate to zero in the district. The number of HIV positive pregnant women too has reduced considerably in the district in the past five years. While 79 out of 14,764 pregnant women tested positive in 2007, the number has decreased to 20 out of 19,515 in 2012.","['hiv', 'decline', 'positive', 'percentage', 'pregnant', 'number', 'women', 'transmission', 'kishore', 'pctp', 'district', 'cases']","MANGALORE: The number of HIV positive cases is on the decline in Dakshina Kannada district for the past five years.While the district recorded 1,225 positive cases in 2007, the number has come down to 916 in 2011 and 778 in 2012.The district has one more reason to cheer.
The percentage of HIV positive cases in the district is much lesser than that in Karnataka.

407,20-12-2012,['Kounteya Sinha'],https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg,"NEW DELHI: India recorded around 60,000 fewer deaths due to HIV in 2011 compared to 2007 while the overall number of people living with HIV has fallen by almost 1.7 lakhs during the same period.There has been a 57% reduction in new HIV infections in India during the last decade with HIV prevalence among adults (15-49 years) dipping to 0.27% (2011) compared to 0.33% (2007).The total number of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) in India is estimated at 21 lakhs last year. Children (below 15 years) account for 7% of all infections, and 86% are in the 15-49 age bracket.Worryingly, of all the HIV infections, 39% (8.16 lakhs) are among women , most of whom being housewives.The new HIV estimated released by Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad on Friday – on the eve of the World AIDS Day — says that around 1.16 lakh new HIV infections among adults and around 14,500 new infections among children had occurred last year.Of the 1.16 lakh estimated new infections in 2011 among adults, the six high-prevalence states of Andhra Pradesh Tamil Nadu , Karnataka, Maharashtra, Manipur and Nagaland accounted for 31% of new infections.Considerable declines in HIV prevalence have been recorded among female sex workers at national level (5.06% in 2007 to 2.67% in 2011) and in most of the states, where long-standing targeted interventions have focused on behaviour change and increase in condom use. Declines have been achieved among men who have sex with men (7.41% in 2007 to 4.43% in 2011) also, though several pockets in the country show higher HIV prevalence among them with mixed results.Reduction in HIV cases among Injecting Drug Users (IDUs) at the national level haven’t been significant (7.23% in 2007 to 7.14% in 2011).Besides north-eastern states where declines have been achieved, newer pockets of high HIV prevalence among IDUs have emerged over the last few years, mainly in states like Punjab, Chandigarh, Delhi, Mumbai, Kerala, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh , Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.The report says that scale up of free anti retroviral treatment (ART) since 2004 has saved over 1.5 lakh lives till last year.At the current pace of scale up of ART services, it is estimated to avert around 50,000–60,000 deaths annually in the next five years.Azad told TOI, “India’s progress in controlling the deadly virus has been remarkable. China, India and South Africa are the only three countries which have witnessed a fall in new HIV cases by over 50%. The recent UN general assembly on HIV unanimously hailed these countries for such progress.”In 2011, among the states, Manipur has shown the highest estimated adult HIV prevalence of 1.22%, followed by Andhra Pradesh (0.75%), Mizoram (0.74%), Nagaland (0.73%), Karnataka (0.52%), Goa (0.43%) and Maharashtra (0.42%).Besides these, Odisha, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, and Chandigarh have shown estimated adult HIV prevalence greater than the national prevalence at 0.27%.The study said, “The adult HIV prevalence at national level has continued its steady decline from estimated level of 0.41% in 2001 through 0.35% in 2006 to 0.27% in 2011. Similar consistent declines are noted among both males and females at national level.”About 1.48 lakh people died of AIDS-related causes in India last year. Deaths among HIV infected children account for 7% of all AIDS-related deaths. Wider access to ART has led to 29% reduction in estimated annual AIDS-related deaths during NACP-III period (2007-2011).Thanks to fall in India’s HIV numbers, south-east Asia (11 countries, including India) has seen a 35% dip in new HIV infections, from 3.2 lakhs (2001) to 2.08 lakhs (2011). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the HIV epidemic is clearly reversing. In 2011, 2.2 million people across the world were infected with HIV and 1.7 million died, half a million fewer new infections than 10 years ago, and 6 lakhs fewer deaths than 2005. However, the global health watch dog said the region also faces serious challenges. In the region, 46% of adults in need of treatment were enrolled in care and treatment by the end of 2011 – up from 12% in 2005. The coverage for HIV treatment in children is 39% in 2011 – up from 9% in 2005. Starting treatment early reduces morbidity and mortality due to HIV, and recent studies have also confirmed the prevention benefits of early treatment in uninfected regular sexual partners of HIV-infected individuals.“The overall decline in the region is cause for increased optimism, however complacency now could become our greatest enemy,” said Dr Samlee Plianbangchang, regional director of WHO south-east Asia.“Those most vulnerable to HIV are also among the least empowered and HIV prevention care and treatment services for these people need to be made available and accessible,” he added.","['60000', 'hiv', '2011', 'lives', 'estimated', 'deaths', 'states', 'prevalence', 'infections', 'lakhs', 'treatment', 'india', 'claimed']","China, India and South Africa are the only three countries which have witnessed a fall in new HIV cases by over 50%.

The state's apex body for control of HIV/AIDS in Goa, incidentally, doesn't receive data of blood tests done at private laboratories, so the numbers-including the overall for the state-could be higher, said officials.The only other taluka to see a rise in HIV numbers this year is Ponda-two up from 26 recorded last year. Most of the other 11 talukas have seen declines.Commenting on Canacona's rise in numbers, GSACS project director Dr Rajananda Desai said the tourist-centric beaches in the taluka-Palolem and Galgibaga-could have contributed to the overall numbers. The coastal belts of the state have always been considered very vulnerable to the virus.Remarkable declines in numbers were recorded in Salcete (52; down 34 from last year's 86), Mormugao (77; down 37 from last year's 114), Tiswadi (33; down 26 from 59), Quepem (10; down nine from 19) and Pernem (4; down seven from 11).

Agencies working for HIV prevention in the state attributed the high prevalence to migration.Project director of Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) Ramesh Devkar said: “While more people are approaching care centres, migration is one of the main causes why we continue to remain a hotbed.”The state has come off as the worst for HIV among female sex workers (FSW) with prevalence at 6.89% against a national average of 2.67%.

But while most AIDS patients see death staring at them, this gutsy 40-year-old woman and her 15-year-old son have refused to let the demon run havoc in their life.Aruna Sarkar's husband Sujoy committed suicide in 1999, unable to come to terms with the fact that he was HIV positive. By then he had already passed on the virus to Aruna and the couple's only son Debaditya. On World AIDS day the mother-son duo prays that no one in this world gets infected for no fault of theirs.Everything looked rosy for Aruna and Sujoy when they tied the knot in 1996. A few months later Sujoy left for Mumbai to work as radio officer with an oil major. He would come back to stay with his family in their Salt Lake house during leaves. It was during such trips home that his family noticed him falling ill often. Though Sujoy had got his HIV status detected in Mumbai, he did not dare share it with any of his family members, not even his wife.""My husband probably could not accept that fact that he had the virus. In addition the guilt that he might have infected me and my son probably led him to commit suicide in July 1999. My son was a little less than two years then,"" Aruna recounted.There was worse to come. Sujoy's parents blamed Aruna for his HIV status and consequent suicide. She and the toddler were thrown out of the house. With advice from doctors, the mother-son got themselves checked and found that they were both infected. Since then they have been living with Aruna's parents in Baguiati.""My world came crumbling down for the second time when we both tested positive for HIV. My son became really ill in 2004. But Dr Subhashis Bhattacharya, who works at the apex clinic in Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, came as a godsend. He not only helped us with the treatment but supported us mentally through counseling. He made us believe that AIDS is not the end of the world,"" Aruna told TOI.Aruna's elder brother and parents stood rock solid behind her. Aruna, who is a science graduate, gives private tuition to fund his son's education. Debaditya is preparing for his Class X board examination. ""I am very positive about life. Come what may, I do not let HIV affect my life. But I do not want my friends to come to know about it as the infection is still a taboo for many. I only wish no one gets the infection for none of their fault,"" Debaditya said.""The amount of grit and courage Aruna has is incredible.

My earning through private tuitions is too meagre and irregular at times. I want a job but I do not know who would offer me one. Also will any organisation give me a job if they know my HIV status?"" wondered Aruna.While teaching the chapter on HIV in biology Aruna does not forget to tell her students never to indulge in unprotected sex.

The mom-to-be, who hails from the Old Town area, discovered to her horror that she had tested positive for HIV/AIDS What unfolded thereafter was nothing short of a tragedy. The child she gave birth to was born HIV positive and died within weeks of birth. Her husband Raju (name changed), whom she married in 2008 and was one who allegedly passed on the infection to her, died a few months ago because of infections generally associated with the disease.Now Sujatha's family members have lodged a police complaint with the One Town police station against Raju's family, alleging that he deliberately hid his HIV status at the time of marriage and infected an innocent woman. They are demanding that Raju's family bear the cost of Sujata's treatment, as she hails from a not so well-to-do family.""She is on ARV (anti-retroviral drugs) and her monthly medicine bill alone comes to about Rs 3000. The drugs along with other medicines and nutritional food are very costly. She was infected by her husband and now it is their turn to take care of her,"" her mother Savitri said.Similar cases of persons getting married without disclosing his or her health status are on the rise. Recently, another such case came to light in a very well-known and affluent family. Luckily the bride's parents came to know about the groom's HIV positive status on the wedding morning and demanded he undergo a medical test due to which he was caught, says Dr Kutikuppla Surya Rao, a doctor who has been treating HIV/AIDS affected since the last two decades.But most cases do not come to light due to the stigma attached to the disease. In fact, police officials at One Town station admitted that Sujata's was the first such case to be lodged with them. ""We are aware of such things and will not hesitate to book a case but most people do not come forward as stigma of being HIV/AIDS positive still prevails. Things can change only when people come out of their shell and lodge a complaint,"" said an official of One Town police station.For several years, this has been the subject of a raging debate - should both the bride and the groom be made to undergo HIV/AIDS test before marriage?""This issue was first raised at a NACO summit chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2001. The discussion then moved to Parliament but never translated into an Act or rule. It has been watered down to the level that if an innocent woman or man is infected by his or her partner, then he or she can lodge a complaint in the police station or file a case for compensation or treatment charges. But that is not sufficient in the present condition,"" pointed out Dr Surya Rao.The medical practitioner says that such cases have been on the rise and he has seen about 30 to 40 such cases in the last two years. ""In a majority of the cases, it has been men infecting women, with just a few stray cases the other way around. And 80 per cent of them were aware of their HIV status. Being aware and then getting married is a crime. Though 2012 is considered to be a path breaking year for HIV/AIDS research as the treatment is moving from prevention phase to cure status, it is still a crime to infect another purposefully. There is, however, no problem if two positive persons get married,"" he said.Though as per a NACO report the prevalence of HIV/AIDS is on the decline, Dr G Prabhakar of Green Vision pointed out that the decline was being witnessed in high risk group such as commercial sex workers (CSWs), truckers and migrant workers. ""The worrying factor is that the growing promiscuity among youth has led to an upswing in the incidence of the disease in the middle and affluent classes. Though there is no survey to establish this fact, as a medical practitioner actively involved in this segment, I think there has been a growth of at least 10 per cent over the last decade,"" said Dr Prabhakar.On the occasion of World AIDS Day on Saturday, the Port City is hosting a number of awareness programmes in tune with this year's theme of 'Getting to zero'. As per the theme, the aim is to achieve zero figure in various areas such as - new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS related deaths' for period 2011-15.Addressing the media here on Friday, additional district medical health officer (AIDS and Leprosy) Ronanki Ramesh said that AP has around five lakh HIV positive persons, of which 5.78 per cent are from Vizag district alone.Kutikuppala Surya Rao, a medical practitioner, who had been treating the HIV/AIDS-infected and affected in the city, said the focus this time was on the student community to raise awareness levels as education plays a vital role in creating awareness. As part of this, a first of its kind human AIDS red ribbon chain would be formed at the campus of Government College for Women at 10 am on Saturday. Apart from this, a 40 feet high burning red ribbon would be displayed there.Meanwhile, the district medical, health and family welfare department in collaboration with the Greater Visakha Municipal Corporation (GVMC) is also organising a rally at 9 am from GVMC to Jagadamba on the occasion. Around 500 nursing students are expected to participate in the rally apart from female sex workers.""A public meeting will also be held from 10.30 am and will be addressed by the district collector and chairman of district AIDS Prevention and Control Committee V Seshadri in the presence of GVMC commissioner,"" Ramesh said.","['hivaids', 'knots', 'hiv', 'positive', 'grooms', 'tying', 'medical', 'aids', 'zero', 'status', 'sorrow', 'family', 'cases', 'district']","The child she gave birth to was born HIV positive and died within weeks of birth.

The prevalence of HIV among pregnant women in the seven coastal districts combined is 0.81 per cent, which is more than the state average of 0.77 per cent.As per AP State AIDS Control Society (APSACS) data, the highest prevalence of HIV among pregnant women is in Kadapa (2.25 %), followed by the coastal district of East Godavari (1.25 per cent). In Krishna (1 %), Guntur (1.08 %) and West Godavari it is close to the state average. Vizag, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam are however a little lower than the state average.Project director of APSACS C Partha Sarathi said, ""We have given special focus on prevention of new infections from pregnant women to newborns during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding. The vertical (mother to child) transmission rate without any medication is around 30 per cent. During the last National Aids Control Programme (NACP), we were able to bring down this transmission rate to about 10 per cent with single dose Nevirapine prophylaxis in the mother-baby pairs. But AP is now piloting the superior triple drug regime, which aims at bringing down the HIV infection in newborns to around three per cent.""Recently, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka launched the PPTCT (prevention of parent to child transmission) 'triple drug regimen'. ""There will be a paradigm shift with the triple-drug regimen. The state is now looking forward to bringing down the mother-to-child transmission to zero,"" said state epidemiologist K Jaya Krishna and deputy director (monitoring, evaluation and surveillance), APSACS.Ronanki Ramesh, additional district medical and health officer (AIDS and leprosy), Visakhapatnam, said, ""Around 85 per cent of HIV transmission happens due to unsafe sex, while around 15 per cent is passed on from the pregnant mother to the child. It's now possible to stop vertical transmission by 98 per cent with the use of a combination of three ARV drugs starting from 14 weeks of pregnancy irrespective of CD4 count till the end of breastfeeding that is up to one or one and a half years. Soon after delivery, the infant will be given Nevarapine syrup for six weeks to be followed up for DBS-PCR tests till 18 months. The triple drug regimen under Mamta Plus programme also spikes the risk of drug resistance,"" he stated.AP is planning to give special importance to counselling and testing programme in the coming year and has set a target for 35 lakh tests (including 15 lakhs pregnant women).Overall, according to APSACS, new infections are on the decline in the state with an approximately 23 per cent decline in new infections being recorded in 2009 in comparison to 2006.

As things turned out, she got married and got infected. The husband is no more but there’s her, two children and the virus.In a country where people living with AIDS are still subjected to ostracism, a lone HIV positive woman with two children did not really stand a chance. But there is something to be said about sheer grit. If you have it, even gunny bags can give you a lease of life. In Sangeeta’s case, the gunny bags came with something even more precious – dignity. The feisty lady has received a bulk contract from a Kalka-based company to sew gunny bags for Rs 4,000 month. On World Aids Day, nine women living with AIDS joined her to make a living sewing gunny bags. She calls women living with AIDS on her mobile phone. One, she proudly points out, she bought herself.At 31, Saumya is treading the same path. Like Sangeeta, Saumya lost her husband, who was HIV positive. Unlike Sangeeta, the legacy she received included not only HIV but also TB. It was not possible for her to work anywhere till people from the drop-in-centre approached her to help her earn by stitching gunny bags. She is also trying to reach out to women deprived of care when they need it the most. “I have seen the vicissitudes of life and I am trying to guide women suffering the same way,” she said.It was Archana, in-charge of the drop-in-centre who conceived the idea of helping women with the craft of making polybags. Archana, who lives with AIDS herself, plans to expand operations to include more women in the ambit of the self-sustaining group.“We went to Anandpur Sahib a few days ago where we saw women working on recycled paper for a well known company. Though the marketing was not impressive, it generated Rs 1,500 per month. We decided to modify the concept and raise income for the women,” she said.While the centre has a special machine to imprint the names that buyers want, they also plan to buy a machine which can be used to make disposable cups and glasses. “With these self employment schemes, we will expand services to all 100 women living with HIV in the city,” said Archana.","['positive', 'hiv', 'aids', 'sew', 'lives', 'selfreliant', 'join', 'forces', 'gunny', 'women', 'archana', 'trying', 'living', 'bags', 'sangeeta']","CHANDIGARH: AIDS would have remained a distant notion for 34-year-old Sangeeta, had the man she married told her he was HIV positive .

The demonstrators claimed that the ART centres lacked sufficient doctors.

The largest numbers of HIV positive people are in Patna district. There are 207 integrated counselling and testing centres where people are tested for HIV and counselled accordingly. Bihar has sought help from the Centre for making arrangements for HIV/AIDS tests at every health centre across the state.BNP+ members from UP, Madhya Pradesh Chhattisgarh , Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan participated in the demonstration. Supreme Court lawyer Anand Grover termed the arrest of Ranjan a clear violation of fundamental rights to speech. ""Continued denial of basic medicines and services to HIV positive people is a denial of the fundamental rights to them,"" said Manoj Pardeshi from New Delhi. Secretary, BNP+, Raj Kumar Singh said not only doctors do not come to the ART centres, even basic paediatric medicines are not available for the children found HIV positive.Sunita from Muzaffarpur said she has to travel 35kms to the ART centre for drug.

They accused the Bihar State AIDS Control Society (BSACS) of ill-treating the HIV positive people.There are around 12,000 people with AIDS in Bihar, while another 55,000 are HIV positive.
The largest numbers of HIV positive people are in Patna district.
""Continued denial of basic medicines and services to HIV positive people is a denial of the fundamental rights to them,"" said Manoj Pardeshi from New Delhi.

The condition of such patients, who stop responding to Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART), continues to deteriorate despite restarting earlier medication. So, they need to be put on the second line of ART treatment.“We keep telling patients at every visit not to miss medicines. But some of them do land up with first line failure and have to be put on second line. GMCH started this facility last year. The viral load in these patients is extremely high. We identify them, send them to Mumbai to assess viral load, and if they need second line ART, they are put on it immediately,” said professor and head of medicine at GMCH Dr YB Bansod.Second line of ART is available at only five centres in the state, at the government medical colleges in Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad, Nagpur and Sangli. Till October this year, total 1,546 patients were on second line. City has second line ART centre at GMCH, where 144 patients; 124 men, 17 women and 3 children, are being treated.Patients say that lack of awareness, carelessness, casual attitude and poverty play a big role in the discontinuation of medicine, leading to second line treatment.Kalabai was told of her positive status during pregnancy tests at GMCH. Since she was put on mother to child prevention drugs, her son is negative. Being poor, she had taken shelter in a missionary ashram for some time, and has now left her son there to study.Others on second line have similar experiences. Sunita from Yavatmal was accompanying her husband who is on second line. “I didn’t feed my daughter . I am also positive, but my daughter is not. I work as a maid to keep the family going since my husband gave up his job as a driver. He caught HIV from sexual relationships while away on the job,” she said in a choked voice.Surekha (51) from Umrer tested positive only after her husband died, and is now on second line. Her two grown up sons take care of her. Ramratan, from a village near Pandhurna, admits he had sexual relations with CSWs, which led to the HIV. “Now, I have no means of earning my daily bread. My brother supports me with food and travel charges,” he said.Subhash from Jharkhand, now a resident of Nagpur, too admits he had multiple sexual partners while working as a driver. Put on second line about four months back, he has brought his family to Nagpur and told his wife and children about having tested positive for HIV.Surprisingly, Sanjiv Waghmare, a sanitary worker, claims that he never missed his medicine, and yet landed up with failure of first line. “I had an alarm in the mobile and would stop anywhere to take the medicine when it rang. God knows why I still developed resistance,” he said.","['hiv', 'positive', 'medicine', 'life', 'patients', 'second', 'sexual', 'nagpur', 'husband', 'art', 'gmch', 'line', 'gives']","So, they need to be put on the second line of ART treatment.“We keep telling patients at every visit not to miss medicines.

Zero discrimination” may have been the theme of the World AIDS Day on Saturday.But for Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad , it’s an unreachable target in the near future. He has strongly contradicted the global theme. The minister told TOI “in no way can India achieve such a target in the near future. In fact no country can do so.” “Zero discrimination”, according to him, is a far cry.On Friday, Azad told Parliament that discrimination is rampant in India.The minister said the operational guidelines for ART services clearly mention that “irrespective of HIV status of a person, all patients are entitled to receive general and special out patient and inpatient services in a hospital.”He added that “confidentiality should be maintained at all levels irrespective of HIV status as per medical ethics and the law.” But he admitted that cases of discrimination “are reported from time to time”.According to him, in the last three years, 21 cases of discrimination have been reported – nine from Karnataka, Delhi (4), Madhya Pradesh (3), Bihar (2) and Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Odisha (1 each).Around 11 cases of suicides by HIV/AIDS patients have also been reported during the same time – 6 from Karnataka, Gujarat (3) and Delhi and Tamil Nadu (1 each) to the state grievance redressal committees.North Indian states, he felt, need to follow the example of their southern counterparts in controlling HIV.“North India has been slow to address the HIV threat. Southern states have done better,” said Azad.New HIV infections in children are down, but reaching the goal of an AIDS-free generation requires that more HIV+ pregnant women receive antiretroviral treatment to decrease the risk of infection for their babies, said Unicef on Saturday.In India over 14,000 children got infected last year — a 13% decline from 2009. The number of estimated deaths among children (0-14 age group) due to AIDS was 10,213 in 2011.The total number of people living with HIV in the country has seen a decline from approximately 2.3 million to 2.1 million. The drop has been much higher among men (16%) than women (2.6%).“Thanks to remarkable global commitment, the world has seen a 24% reduction in new HIV infections in children – from 430,000 in 2009 to 330,000 in 2011. Much progress has been made in the field of treatment. In low and middle-income countries, coverage of effective antiretroviral treatment for preventing mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) reached 57% in 2011,” Unicef added.Regarding access to treatment of children in need, it increased from 6% in 2006, when the pediatric HIV programme was launched in India to 34% last year.“It is simply wrong that adults are twice as likely as children to receive the treatment they need,” said Anthony Lake , executive director of Unicef. “By definition, an AIDS-free generation depends on protecting the youngest and most vulnerable from HIV infection. We must do still more to help mothers and children who live with HIV be able to live free from AIDS.We must rededicate ourselves to boosting the number of pregnant women and children being tested and treated through basic antenatal and child health programmes,” he added.","['zero', 'positive', 'hiv', 'discrimination', 'unrealistic', 'receive', 'children', 'patients', 'unicef', 'reported', 'world', 'women', 'ghulam', 'india', 'target', 'treatment', 'nabi']","NEW DELHI: “Getting to Zero: Zero new HIV infections.

She was pregnant when she found out that her husband was HIV positive and had concealed the information from her. Betrayed, she came back. The bigger shock came when pregnancy tests revealed that her husband had passed the virus on to her.""I had seen my husband remain ill all the time because of HIV. When I came to India, I consulted a doctor who put me on Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) right away and asked me to have a nutritious diet. I made it my mantra. Except for normal coughs and colds, which normal people suffer during changes of season, I have not remained ill,"" says Manisha.Manisha says her good health prompted her to start a beauty parlour in partnership with her best friend. ""I feel very energetic and have never felt sick. My attitude towards HIV has changed through my own experience"", says Manisha.Infectious diseases specialist Dr Atul Patel, who was one of the first private practitioners to dedicate himself to treating HIV, says viral load becomes undetectable in patients on ART therapy after just six months of treatment.""With this treatment, only the diagnostic test tells if a person is HIV positive. Otherwise, viral load becomes undetectable in the blood,"" says Dr Patel.""I have a number of patients who have been treated for the last 10 years and a few have lived for more than 12-14 years! My oldest patient is a 96-year old gentleman who has been living healthily with HIV for 12 years,"" says Dr Patel.He says that most patients who have done well have followed their treatments well, have paid attention to what they eat, and more importantly, have had good family support.""Good family support somehow adds years and cuts down the illness"", says Dr Patel.Ahmedabad: When you first meet Manoj Parmar, 31, he appears healthy, with a wide, infectious smile.

Scared and shocked, he was left with no option but to keep this news to himself.After three years of struggle, in 2006, he came out and shared the news with his family. ""I was helpless and didn't know who to turn to for advice. Those three years were the hardest for me since there were no medicines available for treatment at that time,"" he says.His suffering motivated and inspired him to become a counselor in the Family Planning Association of India (FPAI). Now he counsels people suffering from HIV and AIDS. He is one of the few people who is an HIV patient as well as a HIV counsellor.""The most vital aspect for an AIDS patient is that they should take great care that the disease does not spread to another person. My wife is also an HIV positive patient, but we take full preventive measures.""In fact, the couple was living such a normal life that they felt confident adopting the girl child from their wife's first marriage. ""I am very lucky to get moral and emotional support from my family and friends. Their acceptance level has motivated me to live a normal life without any shame or guilt.

But her early childhood was one of hardship and there are many out in the community in want of attention.According to Berlin Jose , founder-director of Russ Foundation, each of these children have a story of their own, but have successfully come out of their trauma and are doing well in the mainstream education system. Chittu for example was born to a female sex worker who made her income on the streets of Madurai. The woman who had a partner who was already married and had two children, was being used by him to make money. When she became sick and realized she was going to die of AIDS, she brought her three-year-old child, who was already begging on the streets of Madurai, to the home for adoption. She died a few days later. Her partner, however, who could not prove that he was the biological father of this child, was reluctant to give up the child because he had already chalked out plans to make money by making her beg. ""We went through a tough battle with him before the authorities handed her over to us,"" said Jose.Initially, the girl's stomach which was used to scavenging on food on the roadside, could not tolerate the well cooked warm food offered at the home. This HIV positive child suffered frequent bouts of diarrhoea. Staff at the home sometimes found her searching garbage bins for food and feeding on leftovers. ""It took us two whole months to bring her around and now she is doing very well in a normal school,"" he said.Apart from the children of the home, the foundation also works with 77 HIV positive children living in the community and about 650 non-infected children of HIV positive parents.This foundation has been able to successfully integrate HIV positive girls and boys into mainstream society, by their regular counseling and life skills classes. But according to Jose, girls more than boys face a lot of trauma on attaining puberty because society tries to stigmatize them as immoral persons. ""This is when they start hating their parents who are no longer alive. These girls become suicidal and depressed and need a lot of handholding to start realizing their potential as good individuals in society,"" he said.Boys on the other hand start thinking of life ahead and a future.

The cloth-like fibres can be woven from medicine into extremely thin ‘webs’ . They are then designed to dissolve after use, either within minutes or over several days.The team was given $1 million to develop the technology, which uses an electric field to charge fluid through air to create the very fine , nanometre-sized fibres . “Our dream is to create a product women can use to protect themselves from HIV and unintended pregnancy,” Kim Woodrow, a UW assistant professor of bioengineering, said.“We have the drugs to do that. It’s really about delivering them in a way that makes them more potent , and allows a woman to want to use it,” Woodrow said. “This method allows controlled release of multiple compounds.

However, a year later, still unhappy with his fate, he's coping well and feels that the early detection, though unintended, saved his life.What happened to Prakhar brings to fore the grim reality of high prevalence of HIV positive people in the state who are ignorant of their status.Data provided by Chhattisgarh State AIDS Control Society ( CSACS ) reveals that of the total people who donated blood in 2011 in the state as many as 157 were found to be HIV positive. These people were not aware of the fact that they were carriers of the deadly virus. The detections happened as the donated blood is mandatorily tested for HIV virus and is completely destroyed, if found infected.Statistics show that there are 16 government and 22 private blood banks in the state, which collect blood through camps and also through replacements. Last year, 8185 units of blood was collected in camps and 50,132 people donated voluntarily.Of the 50,132 voluntary donations, 157 donors were found positive for HIV, implying that one out of every 320 people were carriers of the AIDS virus. According to the Chhattisgarh State Aids Control Society, transfusion of HIV-infected blood is also a major reason for transmission of the virus.The society stated that one should take blood only from a licensed blood bank where it is tested for HIV.In 2008, around 10,534 people had donated blood out of which 145 were tested HIV positive. In 2009 this figure increased to 150, from 24,164 donors. In 2010, of the 49,458 blood donations 154 were found to be positive for HIV.To deal with the problem, the CSACS has taken the issue seriously and kick-started awareness campaigns on HIV/AIDS , interacting with people in their local dialects on the requisite precautions to be taken for the disease.","['positive', 'hiv', 'aids', 'blood', 'prakhar', '157', 'virus', 'tested', 'state', 'society', 'donated', 'donors']","RAIPUR: Like any well-meaning citizen, Prakhar (name changed), a young man in his mid 20s, went to donate blood at a camp last year to fulfill his social responsibility.

Big question, however, is what after them?Mamta Godghate, 70, and grandmother of 13-year-old Satyajeet (all names changed), whose parents died when he was just three, narrates the spine chilling story of she working day in and out as a daily wager breaking stones for road making to earn daily bread for her grandson and her sick husband. Tears roll down her cheeks but her words are full of determination. ""I know I am old but I will strive for my grandson till my last breath. It is my duty. I will make him strong enough to take life in his stride before I die,"" she says.There were many grandparents sharing similar stories at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) on Tuesday during a programme organized by the medicine department's ART (antiretroviral therapy) centre to felicitate children living with HIV/AIDS and encourage them to continue taking medicines and bring a feeling of belongingness in them.Sushma Kathare, grandmother of Kumar who works as farm labourer in Waddhamna, brings her grandson religiously to GMCH once a month.

""I live in Mumbai while my mother lives in Azamgarh district in Uttar Pradesh.

""Here, a mother has given a kidney to her son.

This is the first child — and only the second HIV-infected person — to have been cured of the disease, if the claim announced on Sunday by a research team from Johns Hopkins Children’s Center (JHCC) and the University of Massachusetts Medical School is found to be true.The team hoped that the success could be replicated in other children born with HIV which would pave the way for eliminating the disease among children. HIV-related breakthroughs are rare and finding a vaccine has been a daunting challenge thanks to the ability of the virus to slip through.The researchers put a Mississippi-born infant, whose mother is HIV-positive, to antiretroviral therapy (ART) within 30 hours of birth. The prompt administration led to the cure by halting the formation of hard-to-treat viral reservoirs — dormant cells responsible for reigniting the infection in most HIV patients within weeks of stopping the therapy.A series of tests showed progressively diminishing viral presence in the infant's blood, until it reached undetectable levels 29 days after birth.The infant remained on antivirals till 18 months of age. Ten months after the treatment was discontinued, the child underwent repeated blood tests, none of which detected HIV. Test for HIV-specific antibodies — the infection’s standard clinical indicator — also remained negative throughout.“Prompt ART in newborns that begins within days of exposure may help infants clear the virus and achieve long-term remission without lifelong treatment by preventing such viral hideouts from forming in the first place,” said JHCC virologist Deborah Persaud “Our next step is to find out if this is a highly unusual response to very early antiretroviral therapy or something we can actually replicate in other high-risk newborns,” Persaud added.The only other HIV-positive person to be cured was Timothy Brown , a middle-aged man with leukemia who got cured after receiving a bone-marrow transplant from a donor genetically resistant to HIV infection.In the current case, the New York Times cited experts saying they needed convincing that the baby had truly been infected in the first place. “If not, this would be a case of prevention, something already done for babies born to infected mothers,” it reported. Other experts were quoted as saying that the findings in the baby would probably not be relevant to adults.The researchers said they did not have enough data at the moment to recommend changes to the current practice of using preventive rather than therapeutic treatment for high-risk infants.They said complete viral eradication on a large scale was their long-term goal. “But, for now, (it) remains out of reach, and our best chance may come from aggressive, timely and precisely targeted use of antiviral therapies in high-risk newborns as a way to achieve functional cure,” the researchers said in their report.Functional cure allows a patient to be free of the HIV virus without lifelong treatment, besides preventing HIV replication in the blood. In this case, viral presence is so minimal that it remains undetectable by standard clinical tests. It is discernible only through ultrasensitive methods.“Prevention really is the best cure, and we already have proven strategies that can prevent 98% of newborn infections by identifying and treating HIV-positive pregnant women,” the report said.The UN estimates that 330,000 babies were infected in 2011. This is apart from more than three million children living with HIV around the world. In India, more than 14,000 children got infected in 2011, which accounted for 13% decline compared to 2009. The number of estimated deaths among children (0-14 years old) due to AIDS was 10,213 in 2011.A latest UNAIDS Global HIV Epidemic Report revealed that 72% HIV-infected children in India and South East Asia do not have access to treatment.In India, children accounted for 7% of an estimated 21 lakh people living with HIV/AIDS in 2011. Around 40% (8.16 lakh) of them were women, who are likely to pass on the virus to their children.","['hiv', 'children', 'doctors', 'childrens', 'viral', 'virus', 'hopkins', 'claims', 'center', 'researchers', 'infected', 'infant', 'cured', 'team', 'johns', 'treatment', 'cure', 'tests']","Ten months after the treatment was discontinued, the child underwent repeated blood tests, none of which detected HIV.

Inevitably, they ran into barriers. But determined to fight and overcome all odds, these young Muslim activists of Kalyan Red Ribbon Club (RRC) have today ushered in a silent revolution in this village. This includes an outreach strategy to address HIV+ prevention, care and support and treatment in this vulnerable district.Talking about sex was virtually taboo in this village, so for young Muslim girls, mostly in their teens, initiating any discussion on the issue was to invite controversy. But that is what Amina Khatoon, a 17-year-old girl, has done ever since she was made president of the 70-member RRC. She comes from a poor family and also works as a part-time dressmaker. April 14, 2009, was a memorable day for Amina when Nirdesh (an NGO) link worker Kumkum Kumari, formed the Kalyan Red Ribbon Club (KRRC) at the village with 21 girls. Prior to this, these girls had never come out in the open without ‘purdah’ and mingled with each other freely. The most sensitive and important issue about which they learnt was the disastrous effect of HIV/AIDS “I had to make a huge effort to make these girls understand the challenge of HIV/AIDS, particularly in rural areas, as here it becomes more pronounced in view of stigma and discrimination surrounding HIV, resulting in poor access to health care, and, above all, infections going undetected or treated by unqualified practitioners,” said Kumkum.Soon these girls started spreading awareness about prevention and protection from HIV/AIDS among the rural community. They were also imparted training at various places, which changed their outlook and provided them a broader vision. The effort made by these girls was soon recognized by Unicef too. The girls were then provided a sewing machine and a ceiling fan. Today these girls, apart from generating social awareness are also learning skills like stitching, puppet-making, hosiery making etc to make their life better.KRRC is constantly expanding its base and now has 70 members, of which 20 are young boys. Sajda, Naznin, Momina, Shaba, Ruksana, Raksa, Mohd Raja, Aftab… all are enthusiastically involved in their assignments.

""After two days, I was asked to resume treatment for HIV, even though I had visited the hospital for my mouth ulcer. They said it won't be of any use till my HIV was controlled. When I asked if I could continue treatment at the hospital, they refused and asked me to leave,"" said Tariq, a resident of Rajabazar.In immense pain and barely able to speak, Tariq was taken to a private hospital by neighbours on Wednesday. He received blood transfusion at the hospital and got his first dose of chemotherapy on Sunday. Doctors said his oral cancer needs greater attention now, for his HIV is under control. ""HIV might have triggered the oral cancer. Often, it causes lymphoma, oral cancer or cancer in the genitals. But contrary to what he was told at the government hospital, Tariq's ulcer needs to be treated now. It seems he was shooed away due to his HIV status,"" said Ashish Mukhopadhyay, who is treating him. Although his condition was serious, Tariq was still in a state to receive palliative therapy that could keep him reasonably healthy for a few more years, he added.Deserted by his wife, Tariq is now looked after by his two brothers. He has not been able to work for the last six months. ""With each passing month, he has been getting weaker. As if the HIV was not bad enough, he got oral cancer six months ago. The pain has been excruciating and he has barely been able to eat. But the treatment at the government hospitals was shocking. They just refused to treat him,"" said Mohammed Moin, his brother-in-law.RG Kar authorities, on the other hand, argued that HIV-positive patients are often asked to continue treatment for the virus when they seek redress for another ailment.""As the rules say, HIV patients are treated on a par with others. We are not permitted to disclose their HIV status even to the hospital staff. But we must handle them carefully, for they are carrying a contagious virus. So, we often advise them to make sure that they continue their treatment for HIV and are referred to our HIV centre. Strangely, patients often take this as refusal. I am not aware of Tariq's case, but it seems unlikely that he was shooed away just because he had the disease. At any given point of time, RG Kar has at least 8 to 10 HIV patients who are being treated alongside the rest,"" said Ajoy Ray, medical superintendent of RG Kar.The West Bengal Aids Control and Prevention Society said it was illegal to either refuse treatment or turn away an HIV patient. ""In case we receive a complaint, we shall investigate the matter,"" said Himadri Sekhar Sanyal, the deputy project manager of the society.Mukhopadhyay pointed out that while Tariq needed to carry on his HIV treatment, his oral cancer (buccalmucosa carcinoma) was worsening and might have caused death. ""Without chemotherapy, he wouldn't have survived more than a few months more,"" he said.","['hospital', 'hiv', 'asked', 'patients', 'shoos', 'bengal', 'tariq', 'cancer', 'kar', 'away', 'patient', 'govt', 'oral', 'treatment', 'rg']","KOLKATA: Campaigns and awareness programmes seem to have done little to change the city's skewed attitude towards HIV patients .

Passing orders on the appeal filed by lorry driver P Ravikumar, the judge said that in 1955 when the Hindu Marriage Act came into existence, HIV was not heard of. However, as per Section 13(v) of the Act if a spouse is suffering from a venereal disease in a communicable form, it is a valid ground for divorce, he said.Justice Ramanathan, noting that he had perused materials available on the internet, concluded that HIV infection being a communicable health hazard, a person testing positive for the virus should be considered an acceptable ground for divorce.“In the year 1955, HIV was not heard of and, therefore, it was not named in the Hindu Marriage Act as one of the grounds for dissolution of marriage. But having regard for the fact that venereal disease in a communicable form has been mentioned as one of the grounds for divorce, any such disease will also come under the provision of the Section 13(v). Therefore, it cannot be contended that HIV-positive condition is not included under the section and therefore divorce cannot be granted,” Justice Ramanathan said.The matter relates to the matrimonial dispute between the couple from Sankagiri in Salem district. On an application from Ravikumar, a sub-court dissolved their marriage on April 3, 2007. However, hearing the appeal filed by his wife, the additional district court in Salem on January 31, 2008 ruled that divorce cannot be granted. Ravikumar then approached the high court.When the matter was taken up for hearing, his wife’s counsel denied that she was HIV-positive and argued that since her husband was a driver visiting various places during his duty, if at all she is afflicted with HIV, she must have got it only through her husband. While the Hindu Marriage Act had specifically stated that venereal diseases in a communicable form could be a ground for divorce, it had not said anywhere that HIV-positive condition could be a ground for dissolution of a marriage. The divorce plea of Ravikumar, therefore, is not maintainable, she submitted.However, when the court asked the couple to undergo tests at the Government General Hospital in Chennai, Ravikumar alone complied with the order. His wife refused to undergo any tests voluntarily, despite two directives from the court.","['hiv', 'court', 'act', 'venereal', 'divorce', 'hivpositive', 'ground', 'equates', 'grants', 'ravikumar', 'hindu', 'disease', 'man', 'marriage']","Passing orders on the appeal filed by lorry driver P Ravikumar, the judge said that in 1955 when the Hindu Marriage Act came into existence, HIV was not heard of.

HaiSitaMukhopadhyaySandeepDilipKurjiGougheducationistsShankerDuttMunibaVeliathVandanaNairSanatSinhaParveenAmanullahBharatiyaNrityaKalaMandirMaidanIACMThis Sunday evening on May 19, 2013, people from all walks of life will participate in the memorial service, which falls on the third Sunday of May. It is a day dedicated to the memory of those lost to HIV and AIDS. The lighting of the candle is an important part of the ritual. ""What's the use of lighting a candle?"" scoffed a sit- at- the- computer smart-aleck-Facebook troll.On that hot summer night of 2001, the 'official' HIV figures in Bihar stood at 35 infected and 1 death. That night, in the glow of the red candles, it was revealed that some 900 people had tested positive during the past five years, and this was with data from just Sens' Lab and Kurji Holy Family Hospital . This news appeared widely in the local press. It, of course, embarrassed the Bihar State AIDS Control Society (BSACS) people who had also come to the 'show', carrying a large BSACS banner.Those red candles flickering in the summer breeze challenged the opaque darkness of ignorance and apathy. A stunned BSACS spokesperson could only say, ""These are not government figures. We don't include data from private hospitals."" The lameness of the retort was self-evident. As a direct consequence, under the leadership of CK Anil, BSACS began improving services and surveillance. When the next IACM was held a year later, BSACS reporting had greatly improved, voluntary counselling and testing centres were being set up, and 1097 HIV/AIDS helplines had been set up.In 2002, the candles brought to light the issues of silence and stigma. They brought to the fore two things: one, that HIV infections were closer to middle class Bihar than reported, and two, that the obsolete Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code was obstructing the battle against HIV and AIDS. Giving the keynote address was a young Bihar-born activist lawyer named Aditya Bandhopadhyay, who was defending the workers of the Naz Foundation International (NFI) in Lucknow, who had been arrested for 'abetting unnatural offences' by distributing condoms and running a sexual health and AIDS prevention centre for non-heterosexual males. 'Integration', one of Kolkata's pioneering Queer Rights groups, performed at the Memorial. It was this year that a symbolic 'Reading of the Names' was started: speaking the names of people lost to HIV and AIDS. The list had some 25 names, people lost to AIDS who were close to the participants and organizers.In 2003, the Memorial had its first transgender guest of honour, Lallan Hijra, who introduced into the Bihar HIV AIDS narrative the voices of the marginalized. She spoke of the trauma of accessing medical services of any kind; how 'hijras' were generally treated like dirt by doctors and nurses alike. She said if Bihar opened its eyes to the fact that transgenders would always be there, and let them access education and skills in peace, they wouldn't be a community forced to dance and beg and be vulnerable to HIV and AIDS. Arriving that day to light the Memorial candle were Arif Jafar and Shivananda Khan. Arif Jafar was the person arrested in the NFI Lucknow case, and he spoke of how media insensitivity and sensationalism coupled with misuse of Section 377 by the police would only cripple society further. The candles also shone on another dark corner, the fate of street children.And so on, year after year, aware and concerned citizens come to light candles in the memory of those lost to HIV and AIDS. We have lit them when Bihar continued to be in denial, hiding under the cloak of being a 'low incidence state', ignoring the stark reality of high migration of labour and the non-availability of testing at district level. We lighted them as realization dawned that Bihar was a 'vulnerable state'. Over the years we have lit candles with sadness as the people lost to AIDS have become familiar, and we have lit them with hope as people with HIV have gained the courage to come out of the darkness of anonymity and speak for themselves.Tonight the candles glow to remind us that HIV is no longer a ticket to death, if only the required ART treatment is made accessible and affordable. They glow to announce that since 2012, we can claim that some 95 children out of every 100 are born HIV free to infected mothers, thanks to the ART regimen for pregnant HIV positive women. They will glow to dispel the myth that HIV is spread through a razor blade. They also light up the fact that there are more than 55,000 HIV positive children, women and men recorded so far in Bihar, and most still face discrimination and stigma.That is why every candle that flickers in the wind is so very important.","['hiv', 'bihar', 'aids', 'light', 'red', 'candle', 'bsacs', 'bihars', 'narrative', 'lost', 'memorial', 'candles', 'glow']","It is a day dedicated to the memory of those lost to HIV and AIDS.

As per records, only 60-70 HIV positive people in these tribal areas are living on anti-retroviral drugs (ART), though there are around 8,000 such patients on ART drugs in the entire district.

Health officials observed that more number of students and people who plan to marry are voluntarily coming forward for HIV testing in urban areas these days when compared to a few years ago when very few opted for the same either out of fear or due to the stigma attached to the disease. Students account for 25-30% of those who are voluntarily opting for HIV testing now, they said.“Screening for HIV before marriage should be made mandatory to check the spread of the disease. Awareness generation for taking precautions is more important than diagnosis and treatment because it’s a deadly disease and once someone gets affected there’s no cure. Pregnant women are tested but their husbands should also come forward for testing,” said Dr Sarada Bai, gynaecologist, King George Hospital.Nowadays, with improved treatment regime and drugs, risk of vertical transmission from mother to child can also be minimised. But vulnerable or affected people shouldn’t shy away from getting diagnosed and treated as it could spread the disease and risk the lives of others,” said the gynaecologist.“Around a year ago, there were just four testing centres in the Agency areas in Araku, Paderu, Chintapalli, and Munchingput but now 45 primary health centres (PHCs) located in tribal or Agency areas have Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs). They have screening kits, counsellors and lab technicians to detect HIV cases,” said additional district medical and health officer (AIDS and leprosy) Ronanki Ramesh.“Still, very few come for screening because of illiteracy, lack of awareness and stigma. Also, as the migrant population and high risk groups aren’t much in these areas, the incidence of HIV is also below 1% unlike in urban areas where it is 2-3%,” said Ramesh.“We are now focusing on ante-natal women and TB patients, as they are the HIV vulnerable group in tribal areas, and are also undertaking screening of husbands. In Paderu region, 30 people were put on ART, while the figure is even less in other Agency areas that have a total of 30-40 people on ART drugs. As for the urban areas, the number of HIV cases put on ART is as high as 8,000,” said Ramesh.“However, the overall incidence is coming down. Five to six years ago, there used to be 7-8 HIV positive cases for every 100 persons in the high-risk groups which has now come down to 2 or 3. High-risk groups include sex workers, truckers, migrant population, transgender and gays,” said Ramesh.“There also seems to be a change in the mindset of the youth and student community especially after red ribbon campaigns were launched in colleges. Those planning to get married or donate blood are coming forward for HIV testing in the three ART centres in King George Hospital (the nodal centre), Anakapalle and Chest Hospital. Earlier, they might have indulged in unsafe sex out of curiosity or peer pressure but don’t want to take the risk now. They are given counselling and asked to practise safe sex,” said Ramesh.P Jaikanth, an engineering graduate, welcomed this gradual change in the mindset among the youth. “Of late I see some of my acquaintances going on their own for HIV tests before marriage, which is a responsible behaviour on their part. But a lot needs to change where the stigma is concerned. HIV positive people shouldn’t be ostracized and society should take a live-and-let-live attitude towards HIV positive people,” he said.","['areas', 'hiv', 'hides', 'positive', 'testing', 'drugs', 'real', 'centres', 'tribal', 'risk', 'art', 'stigma', 'disease', 'picture', 'hamlets']","VISAKHAPATNAM: Reflecting the lack of awareness among tribals and higher prevalence of stigma and misinformation, very few HIV positive cases are being reported in the Agency areas of the district.

There is still no vaccine or cure for itScientists say developing an effective vaccine to prevent HIV infection is one of the most daunting challenges ever faced. One of the main reason for this is that HIV is an incredibly elusive virus.HIV is among the most mutating viruses.Scientists have long struggled to decipher how the HIV capsid shell is chemically put together.Senior author Peijun Zhang, department of structural biology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine said, ""The capsid is critically important for HIV replication , so knowing its structure in detail could lead us to new drugs that can treat or prevent the infection,"" she said.""This approach has the potential to be a powerful alternative to our current HIV therapies, which work by targeting certain enzymes, but drug resistance is an enormous challenge due to the virus' high mutation rate.""Previous research has shown that the cone-shaped shell is composed of identical capsid proteins linked together in a complex lattice.But the shell is non-uniform and asymmetrical; uncertainty remained about the exact number of proteins involved and how the hexagons of six protein subunits and pentagons of five subunits are joined.Standard structural biology methods to decipher the molecular architecture were insufficient because they rely on averaged data, collected on samples of pieces of the highly variable capsid to identify how these pieces tend to go together.""The capsid is very sensitive to mutation, so if we can disrupt those interfaces, we could interfere with capsid function,"" Dr Zhang said. ""The capsid has to remain intact to protect the HIV genome and get it into the human cell, but once inside it has to come apart to release its content so that the virus can replicate. Developing drugs that cause capsid dysfunction by preventing its assembly or disassembly might stop the virus from reproducing.""""By using a combination of experimental and computational approaches, this team of investigators has produced a clearer picture of the structure of HIV's protective covering,"" said the National Institutes of Health's Michael Sakalian.""The new structural details may reveal vulnerabilities that could be exploited by future therapeutics.""","['university', 'hiv', 'medicine', 'lead', 'school', 'hope', 'structural', 'vaccine', 'virus', 'zhang', 'shell', 'scientists', 'capsid', 'weakness', 'structure', 'pittsburgh', 'deciphered']","There is still no vaccine or cure for itScientists say developing an effective vaccine to prevent HIV infection is one of the most daunting challenges ever faced.

But because of his irregular visits to the hospital for the therapy, his CD4 count dropped drastically following which he was rushed to the medical college last month.The man was taken home after he became stable and admitted to STM two weeks back since he had become anaemic and was suffering from bouts of diarrhoea.The victim's family members said that he would often skip medicines and needed constant monitoring. His son was hence staying with him so that he could be looked after properly.According to the patient's son, he had fed him and given him all necessary medicines before putting him to sleep around 12 midnight. The son also slept thereafter. At 4.30am, he was woken up by a groaning sound and found his father lying on the floor with blood all around. His abdomen was split open and the intestines visible. A knife brought by the son to cut fruits was used to cut open the abdomen, said police.""Though the doctors attended to him immediately, the patient couldn't be revived as he had lost a lot of blood and the injury was grievous. He succumbed to the injury an hour later,"" said Dr Pradip Kumar Kundu, STM medical superintendent and vice principal.The patient was depressed and suffering from dementia, said doctors. Police believe he was unable to bear the sufferings and hence killed himself. ""The nature of injury appears to be self inflicted. We can confirm if it was suicide or homicide once we get the autopsy report,"" said a senior police officer of the detective department.A 46-year-old patient was found dead under mysterious circumstances at his hospital cabin in School of Tropical Medicine (STM) on Thursday morning. Though it is suspected as a case of suicide, police has registered a case of unnatural death and sent the body for post mortem.The HIV positive patient from Narkeldanga was getting treatment for a cabin at STM. His son too stayed with him at the same cabin to look after him. On hearing someone groaning in pain at the wee hours the son woke up to find his father lying on the floor in a pool of blood. He alerted the nurses on duty who called in the medical officer. Despite giving all emergency medical attention, the man succumbed to the injury.According to the son, he has fed his father and given all medications before putting him to sleep around 12 midnight. The son also slept after that. Around 4.30 am he was awakened by the sound of groaning. He woke up to find his father on the floor will blood all around. To the shock of the doctors who rushed in they found the abdomen of the patient slit deep and wide and his intestine had popped out.""He was attended immediately by our doctors. But the patient had lost so much of blood and the injury was so grievous that he could not revived. He succumbed to the injury about an hour later,"" said Dr Pradip Kumar Kundu, STM medical superintendent and vice principal.The patient was detected HIV positive a couple of years ago. He was on ART drugs for about eight months from Medical College and Hospital Calcutta. But due to his irregularities in going for the ART his CD 4 count had come down drastically as a result he was rushed to the said hospital about a month ago. He was then discharged after being treated for about a week. His family brought him to STM two weeks ago as he had become anaemic and suffered from bouts of diarrhoea.Family members said that the patient would skip medications if he was not monitored by someone. That is how his son stayed with him in the hospital to look after him. Doctors treating him also said that the patient was depressed and was also suffering from dementia. His condition had started improving slightly in the past one week.A knife brought by the son to cut fruit for the patient was used to cut open the abdomen of the patient. Police suspects that he was unable to bear with sufferings and hence took his own life.""The nature of injury appears to be self inflicted and hence it looks like a case of suicide.

The finding was published on Tuesday in the journal PLoS One.Testing the general population just once would cost $1,100 (approx 65,000) per year of life saved (YLS) in the general population, and $800 (47,000) per YLS among high-risk groups. Testing the population every five years would cost $1,900 (1.1lakh) per YLS saved in for the general public, and $1,300 (76,000) per YLS among high-risk groups.Researchers said the main benefit of national testing would be getting more people to learn they are positive and therefore to seek effective care. A secondary benefit would be to curb transmission of the virus.According to the team, the main results are projections of the dollar cost per year of extended life. The World Health Organization’s standard for cost effectiveness is an expenditure that is less than three times the per capita GDP of a country.In India in 2010, per capita GDP was $1,300. A programme is therefore cost-effective in India if the expense is less than $3,900 (2.2lakh) to save a year of someone’s life.They calculated that modern antiretroviral therapies can give HIV-positive people a normal lifespan. In India, which has a thriving generic pharmaceutical sector, first-line therapy costs only $8.61 (500) a month. HIV tests cost only $3.33 (195).The team coded several other parameters into the model including what percentage of people would refuse the test (18%), how many patients who test positive would get care (50%), the prevalence of HIV in the population (0.29%) and others.Jessica Becker of Yale University said, “We were able to show that even if you increase the cost of HIV treatment and care significantly, testing this frequently was reasonable.”Co-author Dr Soumya Swaminathan, director of the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis in Chennai, said the projections will help the country in its battle with the epidemic.“As India moves ahead in its HIV prevention activities and aims for zero new infections, expanding testing will be a priority and this analysis should help policymakers make the best decisions,” she said.","['hiv', 'study', 'cut', 'testing', 'test', 'pitches', 'general', 'population', 'yls', 'benefit', 'team', 'universal', 'chennaiyale', 'cost', 'india', 'care']","LONDON: Testing every person in India’s billion plus population for HIV will be cost effective, the first ever study on the benefit of universal HIV testing has found.A team of researchers from YRG Care in Chennai, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Brown, Yale and Harvard universities in the US has determined that providing universal HIV testing every five years would be a cost-effective approach to managing the epidemic.

The first trial to assess whether preventive treatment with HIV drugs could affect rates of infection in people who inject drugs has found that daily tablets of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir), an anti-retroviral drug, reduced HIV incidence by nearly half (48.9%) compared to a placebo , according to results published in the medical journal The Lancet.A team of researchers led by Kachit Choopanya and Michael Martin , chief of clinical research for Thailand's ministry of public health, recruited over 2,400 participants at 17 drug treatment clinics in Thailand.

The court said it was ""absurd'' for him to say it was in the interest of his wife to go in for early detection.Justice Roshan Dalvi heard a petition by Santa Cruz resident Joel D'Souza (name changed), who met Joan (name changed) through a marriage bureau. Both professionals, they married on December 26, 2009. In June 2010, Joan had typhoid and went to her mother's place nearby. Thereafter, Joel stopped calling or receiving her calls. On July 7, 2010, he took her call but told her he would not take her back, without explanation. The medical test report of July 7, 2010 confirmed Joan was cured of typhoid and tests included for HIV antibodies.On July 10, 2010, on reaching her matrimonial home, she found Joel had changed the lock. On October 22, 2010, he filed for divorce alleging impotency/non-consummation of marriage and cruelty. Pending the petition, on March 16, 2011 Joel filed an application praying for direction to Joan to undergo HIV, TB and hepatitis tests along with tests for impotency/failure to consummate the marriage as he suspected she was HIV positive.In his application before the FC, Joel gave many reasons, including fever, tiredness, body ache, dry cough, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and headache. He said Joan had a bloated abdomen although her face, hands and legs were very thin and due to this she wore long outfits. ""On an official website of HIV, it is documented that HIV is medically caused due to accumulation of fat in the stomach,'' he stated. He said she spoke in her sleep using the words 'HIV' and 'AIDS' and mentioned 'Jack Dorsan', who he found on the Internet was in the prostitution business. He said his wife had stored Dorsan's telephone number and spoke to him on the day of their wedding.He said she applied lip balm five to six times a day ""as the best treatment for Herpes Simplex Virus is keeping the lips moist"". Joan said Joel's suspicion was ""reckless, wild and cruel'' and he himself needed treatment.The FC on May 16, 2012 rejected his application with costs saying, however strong his suspicion, he had to prove the allegations by furnishing evidence so that the court can grant him relief. Joel moved the high court in October 2012.Joan's advocate Mini Mathew argued that the July 7, 2010 report confirming she was cured of typhoid was sufficient to hold that it was not necessary to send her for an HIV test. She said Joel had been spreading rumours about her. ""These allegations are stigmatizing. Her reputation is ruined,'' she said.Joel's advocate Uday Warunjikar said, ""He caught his wife taking HIV medicines. If she is not suffering from HIV, why is she afraid of the test?'' he asked.

""The project taught me to speak for myself and stand up for my rights,"" says Asha.Funded through European Union and Christian Aid, the project aims to contribute to the National Aids Control Programme—III's overall goal of halting and reversing the HIV epidemic in India. This was to be achieved by providing non–stigmatized PPTCT services through networks and volunteers.According to Asha, before the PPTCT project, women were neither able to access government health services nor opted for hospital deliveries. After the programme began, there has been a definite increase in both accessing services and hospital deliveries. ""More importantly there has been a drop in the number of children that are born HIV positive,"" says Asha, who shared her experiences at a round table meeting in the capital on Tuesday.District government doctors give lists of HIV positive people to PPTCT volunteers to follow-up.

The trouble for HIV infected Ram (name changed), about whom TOI reported a week ago, were seemingly endless. There was discrimination in getting medical aid at Shiv Prasad Gupta (SPG) divisional hospital. Now, the fate of another HIV patient Vishal (name changed) who, incidentally, has been admitted in the adjacent bed, is also the same. Both these patients lay neglected in ward number 2 of divisional hospital.

However, six days later, Ram is still in the similar situation. So is the case with Vishal.Both patients are suffering from severe gangrene infection in their legs and hands and have the history of intravenous drug addiction. Since both are HIV infected. But the paramedical staff of the hospital has refused to attend them.""They do not even touch me, forget bandaging the wounds. My mother gets the cotton and bandage from the nurses and apply it on my leg, she is uneducated and knows nothing about medicines. I feel helpless. I want to die,'' said Ram, his eyes welling up.According to Vishal, his dressing has not been done from the past one week.

It also does not support any separate ward for these patients. In fact the counselors of Integrated Counseling and Testing Centre (ICTC) in the hospital have also accepted that the hospital staff is not attending the HIV patients properly.The amount of unawareness prevailing in the hospital can be judged from what the para medical staff say.One of them, Saikhu said ""The medical equipments, scissor, knives required for dressing are same for the ward. We cannot use the same equipment to perform dressing on HIV patients. They have separate arrangement at Sir Sundar Lal (SSL) hospital, Banaras Hindu University (BHU).

It has been found that the risk of transmission involved is minimal, just 2%, when the mother is on ARV using a combination drug regime,"" said Dr Jayachandra Reddy, joint director, basic services, AP State Aids Control Society (APSACS).""The child is given nevirapine syrup for six weeks and then septran syrup till the 18th month in case early infant diagnosis or DNA PCR test shows that the child is HIV-negative. In case the child is found to be HIV positive, he or she is put on ARV. WHO ( World Health Organisation ) recommends alternative or replacement bottle feeding only if five factors are satisfied. These include AFASS - Affordability, Feasibility, Acceptability, Safety and Sustainability,"" said the APSACS official.While breast-feeding is recommended for all newborns, there has been controversy over HIV positive mothers breastfeeding their babies but this has now been dispelled with the WHO and doctors dealing with AIDS recommending breastfeeding by HIV positive mothers who are on ARV even in developing countries.According to Dr K Surya Rao, specialist in HIV/AIDS medicine from Dr Kutikuppala Hospital, one has to weigh the risk and benefits while breastfeeding. ""In India, as per WHO, annually, nearly two-thirds of the over 2.4 million child deaths are related to inappropriate infant feeding practices. Due to lack of breast milk, many infants die of diarrhoea and gastroenteritis overnight. Even though there's some risk of vertical transmission involved, there are ways to prevent it too.""""The mother should be on highly active ARV right from pregnancy, depending on her viral load and take a combination of drugs instead of the earlier practiced mono-therapy. The mother should also be comfortable feeding the child as per requirement. Also, a campaign needs to be undertaken, especially in rural and tribal areas regarding non-discarding the colostrum, which is a component in the mother's first milk containing high protein and antibody and boosts the immune system,"" Dr Rao explained.Concurring with experts, Dr Ronanki Ramesh, additional district medical and health officer (AIDS and leprosy) said, ""Mixed feeding with breast and bottle-milk should be avoided to cut down the risk of transmission. Also, in poor or developing countries, women may not have access to safe and affordable replacement feeding options and handling of milk bottles isn't hygienic and triggers more diarrhoea deaths in infants. Therefore, irrespective of the HIV status, mothers on ARV are encouraged to breastfeed their children within one hour of birth.""According to doctors, breastfeeding is the best way to provide ideal food for the healthy growth and development of infants as apart from creating immunity and protecting the baby from infections, it also creates a special bond between the mother and child.","['hiv', 'positive', 'mothers', 'mother', 'child', 'transmission', 'arv', 'feeding', 'dr', 'breastfeed', 'breastfeeding']","VISAKHAPATNAM: HIV positive mothers can breastfeed their newborns provided they are on anti-retroviral therapy (ARV) right through the pregnancy, the delivery and post-delivery period, including the breast-feeding period, to prevent vertical transmission of HIV from mother to child, say medical experts on the occasion of the World Breastfeeding Week that is being celebrated from August 1 to 7 to encourage breastfeeding.According to experts, the HIV positive mothers should exclusively breastfeed their children irrespective of HIV status for the first six months while non-infected mothers can breastfeed till the child reaches two years of age.

Pradesh have been allegedly infected with the HIV virus through blood transfusion in the last four years. Experts attribute such infections to rampant

among blood banks and hasty oversight on the part of the recipient.

AndhramalpracticesAs per the data available on the occurrence of such cases between 2009 and 2012, in different states across the country, mentioned in the Parliament recently, the number of people infected with HIV through blood transfusions in Andhra Pradesh was allegedly amongst the highest in India. In the recent past, instances of transfusion of HIV-infected blood were widely reported from Nellore and Warangal.Amongst the southern states, Tamil Nadu did not report any case, while Karnataka recorded 100 such cases more than AP during the same period. Activists working with the people with HIV say the high numbers can be attributed to the demand-supply gap for safe blood. Voluntary blood donations rates are not high while blood banks peddle infected blood, they said. The failure of the government to rein in such malpractices only makes matters worse.In May, this year, an 18-month-old baby Kavya, was detected with HIV AIDS, which doctors suspect occurred from an infected blood transfusion. The news made national headlines, highlighting negligence on the part of authorities.Narendra Revelli of Centre for Advocacy and Research who has been working for a decade with the AP State Aids Control Society (APSACS) blames private blood banks. ""It is mandatory to check blood for HIV before it is banked. However, owing to the supply shortage, unauthorized blood banks do not discard infected blood even if it tests HIV-positive. There is no possibility of infection if blood is checked and banked properly,"" he said.Revelli said that banks mostly rely heavily on professional donors who donate blood for money and therefore do it on a weekly basis. ""There are several such donors near the clock tower area in Secunderabad and Nampally where there are many private blood banks,"" he added.Officials of APSACS, however, disputed the numbers stating that blood transfusion is the cause of infection in very few cases. Nevertheless, they did not rule out risks of contracting the virus from blood available at unauthorized blood banks. ""The number of cases in which blood transfusion has been established as the cause for infection is much less. However, it should be noted that there is a risk of infection if blood is procured from unauthorized blood banks where testing for HIV may not be performed,"" said Dr J C Reddy of Integrated Counselling and Testing Services (ICTS) wing at APSACS.The figures quoted in the Parliament are those from ICTSs across the country. Experts also said that the district and state health officials do not supervise blood banks.

The five-year-long study, conducted by the Pune-based National AIDS Research Institute NARI ) along with HIV Neurobehavioral Research Programme at the University of California, San Diego, found that people with HIV/ AIDS in India are at higher risk of developing milder neuro-cognitive impairment if treatment is not initiated. The study was completed in May this year.The study has indicated a higher baseline prevalence (47%) of neuro-cognitive impairment in people with advanced HIV infection who are yet to take treatment. Neurocognitive impairment affects cognition (thinking), motor control (body movements) and the psychological state of the individual.The world over, people with HIV infection are living longer and having a better quality of life due to greater access to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Thanks to ART, HIV induced illnesses like cryptococal meningitis have been on the decline. However, conditions like HIV-associated neuro-cognitive disorder (HAND) are still prevalent.The study also assumes significance as earlier studies in the western world were based on the subtype B virus that causes HIV infection. However, in India, clade C is the most common subtype. Based on its characteristics, clade C has been found to affect an individual’s nervous system less severely than other subtypes. It was milder than the subtype B prevalent in Europe and America, researchers say.“The baseline finding of the study suggests that clinicians and healthcare providers must know if people living with HIV have any difficulties with cognition or performing daily activities. The family members or the caregivers should also be told of such conditions so that they can detect changes in the individual and seek timely advice from healthcare providers,” researcher Manisha Ghate, co-principal investigator of the study, told TOI on Thursday.Ghate said, “The routine activities of HIV-infected people may get affected if they have neuro-cognitive impairment. In milder forms, it may be prominent only while performing complex tasks like calculations and multitasking. But it is pronounced in severe forms like dementia and patients may have difficulty even in performing routine daily activities like cooking, bathing and walking. Cognitive impairment associated with HIV has been correlated with the increased complaints of job performance difficulties and poor medication adherence.”Researcher Sanjay Mehendale, the principal investigator of the study, said, “The beneficial effect of ART has been observed in cognitively impaired individuals. The improvement was seen in the domains of learning, executive functioning and motor performance. This beneficial effect was also observed in cognitively impaired individuals with higher CD4 counts.”Even otherwise, healthy people show neurological decline as they age. “But here we have a younger population infected with HIV, so this effect will be greater as they age. Patients need counselling in addition to ART,” Ghate said.When contacted, NARI director Ramesh Paranjape said, “This is the first comprehensive study in India which has additionally evaluated viral and host factors associated with neuro-cognitive impairments in people with HIV.”People with HIV infection are living longer and better due to improved access to antiretroviral therapy. Though neurological opportunistic infections are on decline, non opportunistic conditions like HIV associated neurocognitive impairment (HAND) remain prevalent. It has been shown that the impaired cognitive performance can affect routine activities, employment, adherence to treatment and quality of life. The studies have been conducted globally, but the data on the prevalence and co-factors associated with HAND available from systematically conducted research in India is scanty.This is the first comprehensive study in India which has additionally evaluated viral and host factors associated with neuro-cognitive impairments in people with HIV.Pune-based National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) along with HIV Neurobehavioral Research Programme at the University of California, San Diego.The study was initiated in September 2008 and completed recently in May 2013.The study was conducted in adult population above 18 years of age.The data was collected in three groups: 1) HIV infected individuals with advanced disease (CD4 count less than 200 cells/cmm) : [number of patients were 125], 2) HIV infected individuals with CD4 count between 350-550 cells/cmm : [number of patients were 128] and 3) HIV uninfected individuals [number of patients were 287].All participants received a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation, neuromedical assessment and laboratory evaluation.The neuropsychological test battery that was used in this study was developed at HIV Neurobehavioral Research Center (HNRC) San Diego and standardized in Indian population prior to useAfter baseline evaluations, all individuals with CD4 count less than 200 cells/mm3 received ART treatment as per the national guidelines and nearly 50% HIV individuals with CD4 count between 350 and 550 cells/mm3 were given immediate antiretroviral treatment (they were co enrolled from a ongoing clinical trial).The participants were followed every year for neuropsychological evaluation.

After allegedly waiting for about a week for admission, the 24-year-old was finally taken away by the community members on Tuesday. Last heard, she was on her way to a place in Bihar for 'treatment' by quacks.Heena's fault was that she got castrated in February this year somewhere in Bihar by 'professionals' in the community. Heena was also detected to be HIV-positive about a couple of months back. With no encouragement from the community to go to a hospital, Heena was treated by quacks for a few weeks. But when her condition deteriorated, she sought the help of Association of Trangenders and Hijras in Bengal (ATHB).After running from one official to another at SSKM, Heena was asked to come to the hospital on September 9. She was checked by doctors of the urology department on September 9 and advised admission. But the hospital authority said since Heena had undergone castration, she needed an order from a district judge for admission.""We had no knowledge of this formality. They kept insisting that we get this order from a district judge. How could the patient get it when she herself was unable to move because of the ailment? We were worried about her condition,"" said ATHB secretary Ranjita Sinha.Heena's cries of pain fell on deaf ears as the hospital allegedly kept citing the legal issues. Aggravating the problem was the absence of a separate ward for the third sex. Even as some doctors were sympathetic, they too pleaded helplessness. The hospital also told them that a relative had to sign a risk bond in case admission was granted. Since Heena has no family, her 'hirja gurus' were convinced by ATHB to sign the bond. Accordingly, some from the community came to the hospital. But seeing the delay and the apathy, they took Heena away and she left for Bihar on Wednesday morning.In the meantime, ATHB members sought the intervention of the West Bengal State AIDs Prevention and Control Society (WBSAPCS). While some officials claimed that they were talking to hospital authorities; some pleaded that they were out of station.""Some people from the eunuch community who had come to the hospital were getting impatient.

But, thanks to the exclusive legal aid centre at ART centre in Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH). The centre has so far dealt with 137 cases related to injustice done to patients infected with HIV, who are mostly women.Since its inauguration in April 2010, the legal aid centre has so far handled 153 cases including 78 male and 75 female cases related to various types of discrimination against people infected with HIV. Around 137 cases have been solved outside the court. For instance, a 33-year-old man from Palakkarai in Trichy , who was tested HIV positive after his marriage to a 24-year-old woman in Pudukkottai, died in January 2012. Since her husband succumbed to HIV, the family of her husband harassed her in order to chase her away from them.Moreover, they denied her a share in their property. The woman was brought to the legal aid centre a few months after her husband's death. The advocate and the counsellor counselled the family members of her husband and explained them about the legal consequences they would face if she was denied of her rights. Only then his family agreed to give her share. Initially they disagreed to give her the share as they were under the impression that their son was infected with HIV because of his wife. But the fact was that she was infected with HIV by her husband. ""We are successfully dealing with the case and trying to get justice. The HIV affected people can approach the legal aid centre for solving their problems.

The treatment of patients with HIV has been revolutionized by the advent of combination anti-retroviral drugs.However, although these drugs are highly effective at keeping HIV at bay, they must be taken for the life of the patient and never eliminate the infection completely . This is illustrated by the often rapid resurgence of virus in patients who stop taking these medications.The persistence of HIV is partially due to the ability of the virus to disable the cell's altruistic suicide pathway, which is normally activated when a cell becomes infected or damaged.A team of researchers led by Michael Mathews and Hartmut Hanauske-Abel, previously showed that Ciclopirox, commonly used by dermatologists and gynaecologists to treat fungal infections, inhibits the expression of HIV genes in culture. The drug works inhibits the expression of HIV genes and also blocks the essential function of the mitochondria, thereby reactivating the cell’s suicide pathway.Healthy, uninfected cells examined during this study were spared. And remarkably, the virus did not bounce back when Ciclopirox was removed, researchers said.The utility of Ciclopirox in patients with HIV, for instance after topical application to reduce sexual transmission of the virus, awaits verification in future clinical trials.","['hiv', 'patients', 'researchers', 'eradicate', 'foot', 'virus', 'cream', 'used', 'treat', 'cells', 'suicide', 'ciclopirox', 'help', 'drug', 'antifungal']","WASHINGTON: In a breakthrough, scientists have discovered that a common drug used to treat nail fungus in feet may permanently eradicate the deadly HIV from the body.

It would be followed by camps in Phulpur, Soraon, Karchana and Handia on October 23, November 12, November 13 and November 14 respectively.Dr Shahi said “the department will undertake an intensive drive to apprise migrant labourers of the health camp where they would be offered counselling, testing and treatment facilities.”He further said that a study on migration pattern and prevalence of HIV was already underway and added “officials are also mapping high-risk groups like female sex workers, intravenous drug users and men having sex with men (MSM) so that concrete measures could be initiated to restrict the spread of the virus.”The three categories of migrants responsible for the spread of disease are workers at brick kilns, stone cutting, mining, silica mining centres and service clusters (who migrate from one state to another for livelihood).",2

The new findings of the AIDS-causing virus's complex envelope, includes sites that future vaccines will try to mimic to elicit a protective immune response.

Scientists at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) and Weill Cornell Medical College determined the first atomic-level structure of the tripartite HIV envelope protein?long considered one of the most difficult targets in structural biology and of great value for medical science.

""Most of the prior structural studies of this envelope complex focused on individual subunits; but we've needed the structure of the full complex to properly define the sites of vulnerability that could be targeted, for example with a vaccine,"" said Ian A Wilson, a senior author of the study.

HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus, currently infects about 34 million people globally, 10 per cent of whom are children, according to World Health Organisation estimates.

Although antiviral drugs are now used to manage many HIV infections, especially in developed countries, scientists have long sought a vaccine that can prevent new infections and perhaps ultimately eradicate the virus from the human population.

However, none of the HIV vaccines tested so far has come close to providing adequate protection. This failure is due largely to the challenges posed by HIV's envelope protein, known to virologists as Env.

Env's structure is so complex and delicate that scientists have had great difficulty obtaining the protein in a form that is suitable for the atomic-resolution imaging necessary to understand it.

""It tends to fall apart, for example, even when it?s on the surface of the virus, so to study it we have to engineer it to be more stable,"" said biologist Andrew Ward.

The research team was able to engineer a version of the Env trimer (three-component structure) that has the stability and other properties needed for atomic-resolution imaging, yet retains virtually all the structures found on native Env.

Using cutting-edge imaging methods, electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, the team was able to look at the new Env trimer.

The X-ray crystallography study was the first ever of an Env trimer, and both methods resolved the trimer structure to a finer level of detail than has been reported before.

The data illuminated the complex process by which the Env trimer assembles and later undergoes radical shape changes during infection and clarified how it compares to envelope proteins on other dangerous viruses, such as flu and Ebola.

The findings are published in the journal Science Express.","['hiv', 'vaccine', 'complex', 'unlock', 'env', 'virus', 'protein', 'scientists', 'structure', 'envelope', 'trimer', 'clues']","WASHINGTON: In a breakthrough, scientists have mapped the most detailed images yet of the protein responsible for getting HIV into cells, paving way for a potential vaccine for AIDS.

The study was necessitated as several ethical issues and challenges started emerging, especially in terms of the standard of care of HIV/AIDS patients, due to the increasing commercialisation of the medical profession, the doctor stated.The study sought the opinion of the patients on parameters and ethical issues such as principles of autonomy, paternalism or dictatorship, dignity of individual, informed consent, right to refuse treatment, principles of confidentiality, patient's right to know about his treatment and also role of surrogates (family or relatives).Of the 1,800 HIV positive patients, 1,450 fully participated in the study between March 2011 and February 2013 and are under treatment at KKSR Hospital and Research Centre , Visakhapatnam. After getting complete responses from 1,450 patients, the study found that 65.6% of the patients faced paternalism or authoritarian behaviour from doctors, 55.2% felt they were not treated in a dignified manner, 75.8% patients faced lack of autonomy, informed consent (that is explaining the pros and cons of treatment and contraindications to patients) was not taken from 55.1% patients, 87.2% patients had no choice to refuse treatment, principle of confidentiality about treatment and HIV status was maintained only in 48.2% cases. Further, just 24.1% of patients said they were informed about their treatment procedures and in 86.2% cases, it's the patients' relatives or guardians who spoke to the doctor on behalf of the patients without giving the patients a chance to speak up about their problems.""Overall, it was felt that the United Nations Organisation and World Health Organisation should formulate and implement new ethical guidelines in the treatment and care of HIV/AIDS patients in the background of severe stigma attached to HIV/AIDS,"" stated Dr Rao.Referring to the key points of the study, professor of psychiatry and superintendent of Government Hospital for Mental Health , Vizag, Dr N N Raju, pointed out that HIV-AIDS is one ailment that is associated with a lot of stigma and different socio-psychological aspects are involved, especially in India. ""Many a time, we come across family members who request the treating doctors not to reveal the HIV status to the patient as they fear the patient would get depressed or turn suicidal if they learn the truth. In such cases, getting informed consent becomes difficult.""""Moreover, in India, the doctor-patient ratio is disproportionate and one doctor sometimes has to see around 100 patients a day, which makes giving a patient hearing to each case difficult. More social workers and trained counsellors are required to generate awareness. With effective treatment regime available, HIV, like TB, can be controlled to a great extent and so the stigma needs to be dispelled gradually as has happened in the case of TB in last few decades,"" stated the doctor.","['hivaids', 'issues', 'hiv', 'informed', 'study', 'doctor', 'patients', 'poses', 'sociopsychological', 'ethical', 'stigma', 'cases', 'treatment']","Further, just 24.1% of patients said they were informed about their treatment procedures and in 86.2% cases, it's the patients' relatives or guardians who spoke to the doctor on behalf of the patients without giving the patients a chance to speak up about their problems.

It has been confirmed earlier that if a person becomes infected with two different strains, they can fuse and a recombined form can occur.The new strain found to be the most dangerous has been found in Guinea-Bissau The period from infection to development of AIDS was the shortest reported among HIV-1 types, at around five years.“Recombinants seem to be more vigorous and more aggressive than the strains from which they developed. The recombinant studied is called A3/02 and is a cross between the two most common strains in Guinea-Bissau, 02AG and A3,” said Angelica Palm from Lund University.So far the new strain has only been identified in West Africa, but other studies have shown that the global spread of different recombinants is increasing.“In countries and regions with high levels of immigration, such as the US and Europe, the trend is towards an increasingly mixed and complex HIV flora, unlike in the beginning of the epidemic when a small number of non-recombinant variants of the virus dominated. There is, therefore, reason to be wary of HIV recombinants in general,” Palm added.The virus strain was first reported by Joakim Esbjornsson from the University of Oxford, who is the co-author of the study.An estimated 4.9 million people were living with HIV in Asia-Pacific in 2012. Twelve countries account for more than 90% of people living with HIV and of new HIV infections in the region which includes India, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.Emerging epidemics are becoming evident: between 2001 and 2012, new HIV infections increased 2.6 times in Indonesia, Pakistan has seen an eight-fold increase and new infections in the Philippines have more than doubled.“HIV is an extremely dynamic and variable virus. New subtypes and recombinant forms of HIV-1 have been introduced to our part of the world, and it is highly likely that there are a large number of circulating recombinants of which we know little or nothing. We, therefore, need to be aware of how the HIV-1 epidemic changes over time,” said Patrik Medstrand, professor of clinical virology at Lund University.","['hiv', 'different', 'recombinants', 'hiv1', 'virus', 'discovered', 'strain', 'infections', 'aggressive', 'worlds', 'strains', 'reported', 'epidemic']","LONDON: Scientists have discovered the world’s most aggressive HIV strain Swedish researchers have reported that a recently discovered HIV strain leads to significantly faster development of AIDS than currently prevalent forms.There are over 60 different epidemic strains of HIV and geographic regions are often dominated by one or two of these.

I don’t see myself as a patient any more,” said 60-year-old Murugesh*, a caterer, who was diagnosed as HIV positive two decades ago.

We had married against our families’ wishes. We knew he would have no one if we died,” said the 42-year-old, who was infected in 2001. “My husband died in 2004. My resolve to live only grew stronger after that. I did odd jobs to fund my son’s education. Many people turned me away when they got to know I had AIDS,” said Hema, who had a near death experience in 2006.The gathered people rued that despite awareness campaigns by the government, HIV infected and affected people have a tough time getting a job. “It is sad that they are still identified as patients who have a dreaded disease. While many are waking up to the fact that HIV can’t be transmitted through sharing a glass, the awareness hasn’t gone to the extent of employing infected people. While anti-retroviral drugs has helped manage the disease, we still need to come up with a tool to help them fight stigma,” said S Noori, president of South India Positive Network.Doctors at the hospital said the antiretroviral therapy (ART) over the last decade has helped save a lot of HIV infected people.

Earlier this year, the private firm forced him to resign with a monetary compensation. Adding to his woes, a legislation that promises to punish such discrimination has been in the works for several years now.The HIV/AIDS Bill was drafted in 2006, but is being shunted between the health and law ministries. Activists, lawyers and people living with HIV have been fighting for the Bill to be introduced during the winter session of Parliament. Rallies are planned across the country to highlight the issue on Sunday, World AIDS Day.

The parent-to-child virus transmission has also come down from 67 in 2012 to 23 this year.There are four anti-retroviral treatment centres (ARTs) and link ARTs across the district to clinically examine the suspected patients. After a person is tested positive, the ART medication starts at the earliest. Jagdish Patil , the regional programme officer of the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS), told TOI, ""We are targeting those in the high-risk groups such as male and female sex workers, and trans genders, who are most vulnerable, to spread the awareness about the syndrome. As this group is brought under control, the spread of the virus to the secondary population, such as spouses and children of these people, also decreases. We have brought around 90% infected people to ART centres to provide medication which has significantly reduced the spread.""The District AIDS Prevention Control Unit (DAPCU), along with the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO), is going to conduct a survey among those engaged in cutting of sugarcane for HIV infection. ""The sugar cutters are mostly migratory workers and considered the bridge-population for the virus to spread. However, there is no study about how much these people contribute to the spread of virus. However, the population has the potential risk of transmitting the virus through unsafe sex,"" Patil added.Along with the decline in the AIDS cases among the general masses, the district has also recorded a dip in in the parent-to-child transmission of the virus. ""Last year, about 67 children were infected through their HIV -positive mother. This year, the number has been significantly declined because of te co-ordinating efforts of private and public anti-natal care centres.

Despite this, Nidhi Patel (24) married him recently. It was a love marriage and Nidhi says her love is blind , but positively.In fact, when Vimal spoke about his marriage with a physician, he was told to avoid tying the knot. The doctor advised lying about his HIV status would be unethical and unjust to the girl. He was surprised to know that Nidhi, who knew Vimal for three years, was aware of his disease but determined to marry the Ahmedabad-based sales executive.“I refused to believe my patient and asked him to bring his girlfriend along for counseling. I thought the girl was probably blinded by love and did not know the seriousness of the disease,’’ said infectious diseases specialist Dr Atul Patel. “I was surprised to meet the girl who was aware of the challenges of living with an HIV infected person. In fact, she was adamant that she would not let HIV be an obstacle to her love.’’The marriage is a personal victory of love. But it reflects changing attitudes related to HIV patients as well. Experts say a decade ago, they would have to grapple with not only the physical and mental fallouts of the dreaded infection but also emotional manifestations of the being abandoned out of fear. At least two of every 10 patients would be divorced and many disowned by their families.“The current social scenario for HIV patients is far more positive. Not only do we see a lot of HIV positive patients marrying each other, we are also seeing boys and girls with no infection willingly marrying HIV positive people. This trend signifies a greater acceptance of HIV in society and the fact that HIV is not a death sentence. It is a disease which can be managed with good treatment and care,” said Dr Patel.Sunita, 28, is another person, who married her boyfriend of two years, despite knowing he is HIV positive.

According to the officials, around 250 HIV positive deliveries take place in Vizag district every year.As per the PPCT treatment, HIV testing is conducted on all pregnant women and if found positive, anti-retroviral treatment (ART) is administered from the 14th week of pregnancy, irrespective of the CD4 count. Right after birth, Nevirapine and Septran syrup are given to the baby. Blood tests (DBS-PCR tests) are also done from time to time till the child is one-and-half-years old. If the child tests HIV negative, then he or she can be said to be free from HIV transmission. Breastfeeding is also encouraged since the mother is kept on ART drugs.Additional district medical and health officer (AIDS and leprosy) Dr Ronanki Ramesh said, ""Currently, around 8,000 HIV positive pregnant women are undergoing ART in Vizag as per the government records. We are focusing on zero vertical transmission of the virus from the mother to the newborn and therefore implementing PPCT in every possible antenatal case. This advanced drug regime was introduced on September 2012 as a pilot project in AP and Karnataka and now the success rate is almost 98%. We will soon conduct sensitization workshops for private gynaecologists so that PPCT is followed in every case.""Besides a decrease in vertical transmission in antenatal cases, focus is given on bringing down HIV-TB co-infections.

A UNICEF report says that AIDS-related deaths amongst adolescents between the ages of 10 and 19 increased by 50% between 2005 and 2012, rising from 71,000 to 110,000 and that many adolescents were unaware that they were infected.The 2013 Stocktaking Report on Children and AIDS—released on the occasion of World AIDS on Sunday-- says that an estimated 74% of the 2.1 million adolescents live in 12 high burden countries. It says that investments to the tune of USD 5.5 billion by next year will be required to avoid an added two million adolescents, particularly girls, becoming infected by 2020. Investments in 2010 were US$3.8 billion.“If high-impact interventions are scaled up using an integrated approach, we can halve the number of new infections among adolescents by 2020,” said UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake. “It’s a matter of reaching the most vulnerable adolescents with effective programmes – urgently.”The report also found that girls are more vulnerable among adolescents. Of the total of 2.1 million individuals, 1.2 million are females. The total infected adolescent population in South Asia is 130,000 with 51% men and 49% women.

New infections among adolescents could be halved by 2020 by scaling up high-impact interventions and working across sectors.

But services generally do not keep pace with or cater to their needs. This is particularly true for marginalized adolescents males who have sex with males, adolescents who inject drugs and sexually exploited adolescents despite the disproportionately high prevalence of HIV among them.Experts have advised a combination of high-impact interventions including condoms, antiretroviral treatment, prevention of mother-to-child transmission, voluntary medical male circumcision, communications for behaviour change, and targeted approaches for at-risk and marginalized populations.

She fills up the room when she hurries in. “I can’t hear,” she says, motioning to her hearing aid. Her eardrums were damaged in a car accident when she was three.But her hardest struggle has been to fight the stigma that came with the HIV virus she contracted eight years ago due to medical negligence.The three abortions she underwent between 2004 and 2006 (“Oral contraceptive made me nauseous and my ex-husband didn’t care for condoms”) did her in. The homemaker, blogger and HIV activist believes infected surgical implements may have been used. “Poz? Me? Not possible. There has to be a mistake,” she writes on her blog, recounting receiving the test results when she went in for her fourth abortion. That she had destroyed records of all three previous surgeries meant she couldn’t hold anyone accountable. “The nursing home staff suggested I have the baby because it was my last chance due to the complications the serial abortions had led to.”Until then, Dhawale admits, she knew nothing about the Human Immunodeficiency Virus which triggers the progressive failure of the immune system, allowing life-threatening infections to thrive. “I thought it only happened to those with multiple partners. I didn’t have them, neither did my husband.” The Vasai clinic she delivered her baby at (he is seven years old now), administered Zidovudine, an antiretroviral drug, to prevent transmission of virus from mother to child. Her marriage ended in 2007 — “due to incompatibility, not the infection”, she clarifies — making her isolation complete. The counselling centre run by Kripa Foundation that she was directed to was ill equipped to empower patients with accurate information about medicine dosage, side effects or the nature of the virus.She realised she had to know more. The online information space was one she chose to dip into between 2010 and 2011, sparking off her transformation. Dhawale learnt that virus transmission didn’t stand a chance if partners stayed healthy and the infected person kept the virus count low with medication.“In India, abstinence is the only solution experts offer,” she says, recounting how an ‘AIDS specialist’ she visited in 2012 advised Surve, who was then her boyfriend, against kissing her. “He even suggested we wear gloves while being intimate. Even if traces of the virus exist in the saliva , it cannot be transmitted unless one or both partners have bleeding gums or open sores. It’s the same during oral sex unless one partner suffers from an STD or the viral load is at a detectable level,” she clarifies.In fact, it was during her time online that she met Surve. The two hit it off, and eventually she told him she was HIV+ve. “He disappeared for three months,” she giggles.“I was shocked,” he says. “But not a single day went by when I did not think of her.”Surve, who Dhawale says on her blog, had dilly dallied for two-anda-half years, offered a commitment this August when she was ironically preparing to participate at an HIV matrimonial meet in Pune. Expectedly, there was resistance from Surve’s family. After all, she had a ‘sex worker’s’ disease. “We tell people on a need-to-know basis, and educate them on how it’s transmitted,” says Surve, who admits that it’s family and close friends who are aware that they are a serodiscordent couple.That Dhawale never let the virus rob her vivacity has made sure the couple enjoy a “rocking, fearless but protected sex life”. “There are procedures to follow in case of a condom tear, pills you can take within 72 hours of the act, under the doctor’s guidance,” explains Surve.Their constant effort is to keep the virus load down, reducing any chance of transmission. The medicines that Dhawale takes twice a day at times so precise, the couple set an alarm for it, are personalised based on her lifestyle, and blood, liver parameters. “If you miss a dose, the virus will multiply. If you overdose, the hormones go for a toss,” he says.Does the fear of untimely death hang over the couple? “With proper exercise, diet and medication,” he says, “an HIV+ve person can outlive an HIV-ve one. We are making sure Jyoti does.”Always use a condom. Have your partner tested for HIV before engaging in a physical relationship and/or marriage. Insist that labs, clinics and hospitals use disposable syringes and screens.","['positive', 'hiv', 'surve', 'dhawale', 'sex', 'staying', 'virus', 'transmission', 'hivve', 'didnt', 'finding', 'partners', 'love', 'jyoti']","The homemaker, blogger and HIV activist believes infected surgical implements may have been used.

If the positive cases were about 1,245 in 2007 about 90 cases being reported per month, including pregnant women, now the cases are averaging less 50 per month,"" said Dr Kishore Kumar M, District AIDS Control officer.He pointed out that while in 2007, the test to positive ration was 16% in 2013 it has come to as low as 1.45%. Delineating the statistics, he said, ""In 2007 of the 7,986 persons tested 1,245 were tested positive, in 2013 (till October end) of the 38,985 tested only 567 were positive cases. Last year, as many as 38,294 went in for testing and there were 867 cases. This year, we expect the test number to reach 44,000,"" he said.Dr Kishore said the positive development was that every year from 2007 the cases were coming down by more than 100, hoping to achieve better progress in next couple of years.The most heartening fact is the effective control of transmission of HIV from an HIV-positive mother to her child during pregnancy. Nearly five per cent of infections are attributable to parent-to-child-transmission. Dr Kishore pointed out that froma high of 82 cases in 2007 among 14,764 pregnant women tested, the numbers had come down to 23 in 2012 among 23,575 tested. This year till October 21 cases have been reported among 22,141 tested.Among the cases reported this year till October, Mangalore taluk has the highest number at 214, followed by Bantwal (51), Belthangady (45), Puttur 927) and Sullia taluk reported 15 cases. The rest of the 215 cases are from other districts tested here.Again male numbers are high at 364 followed by women at 203. The prevalence among persons in the age group of 15 to 49 is highest at 472 and it is 80 above age of 49.As of now, from 2006 till date 2,492 persons are being administered ART (Anti-Retroviral Treatment).

So the entire surgical team needs to be alerted about the HIV status of the patient and accordingly, the doctors, medicos and other healthcare personnel associated with the surgery need to take special precautions, wear disposable synthetic gowns and double gloves but often government hospitals run out of special gears and HIV kits. Taking universal precautions for each and every case, assuming all of them to be HIV positive or Hepatitis B positive cases, may not be economically feasible.""The lack of gloves sometimes forces junior doctors or medicos to draw blood samples barehanded, a situation that clearly is alarming for them.

A recent mortality investigation carried out by semi-government entity Institute of Actuaries of India on people living with HIV (PLHIV) shows among the deceased, the illiterate population make for the higher number, unprotected sex is still the commonest reason behind the transmission of HIV, those between 25 and 49 years of age bear 83% of the death burden and there is a significant time gap between a person getting infected and him/her seeking treatment. The study investigated 1,695 deaths between April 2012 and March 2013 in 20 ART centres of five districts, representative of the whole country.The study, carried out with support from the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), is supposed to act as a guide for insurers to design the life insurance cover for PLHIV and price the risks accordingly. In its report, the IAI has suggested that CD4 count at the time of registering for ART, access to regular treatments and educational, economical and social backwardness were among major factors for longevity of life. It has recommended stricter data development and maintenance to NACO The survey report underlines how the uneducated population contributes to 44% of the deaths, even though the rate of infection among them is only about 27%. Education, say experts, clearly has a defining role to play in HIV care but how and why is subject to further exploration. The report says the average time lost before a patient approaches a free anti-retroviral centre is about 7.4 months. “A delay in starting treatment could lead to faster deterioration of a patients’ health and s/he may also fall prey to opportunistic infections, like TB,” said a volunteer with one of the city’s 69 Integrated Testing and Counselling Centres.Most worryingly, the study revealed that in 90% of the deaths, the infection was transmitted through unprotected sex. A NACO official told TOI that despite the exponential success rate of condom use, unprotected sex remained a nagging worry. In Mumbai too, it is a challenge to check the transmission of the virus among high-risk groups such as men having sex with men (MSM). “Over the last five years, MSM in Mimbai has witnessed a drop of 88% in HIV transmission.

He added: “The homosexual act will not disappear but the community seeking help will reduce drastically. Now while treating male patients, doctors cannot ask, ‘Have you indulged in sex with a man,’ and this will have a major impact on detecting new cases.”Dr Kabir Sardana of Delhi’s Maulana Azad Medical College too said that gay patients suffering from STDs may no longer report their illness for fear of being branded an outlaw.In one of its report, the Human Rights Watch had highlighted the bitter truth that India’s battle against HIV/AIDS was made harder by the criminality attached to vulnerable communities. Some of the challenges underscored were thankfully overcome owing to the Delhi HC ruling in 2009 decriminalising gay sex. But, with the latest SC verdict, the obstacles will get resurrected.The issue is particularly pressing. MSMs are a high-risk category for HIV/AIDS. About 7% of the estimated 25-lakh gay persons in India are HIV-infected, according to the Central government. Their marginalization in healthcare was in fact the basis of the public interest litigation filed by the Naz Foundation in Delhi HC.The National AIDS Control Organisation too had conceded in the HC that Section 377 seriously impeded successful public health interventions. “Those in the high-risk group are reluctant to reveal same-sex behaviour due to the fear of law enforcement agencies, keeping a large section invisible and unreachable and thereby pushing the cases of infection underground, making it very difficult for public health workers to even access them,” stated the affidavit.The Human Rights Watch report cited an instance from July 2001, when four NGO staffers in Lucknow working to fight HIV/AIDS among MSMs were arrested and charged under IPC Section 377 (unnatural offences) and for selling obscene material. They were imprisoned for 47 days. Their literature was seized. And the offices of their two NGOs, Naz Foundation and Bharosa Trust, were sealed.The harassment they suffered has been endured over the years by scores of other health workers in Chennai, Bangalore and Delhi.“This (verdict) will have a devastating impact on the fight against HIV/AIDS. In the early days, it was very hard to get MSMs to health units, as they feared police action. This changed only after the Delhi HC judgment,” said Dr L Ramakrishnan of Solidarity and Action Against the HIV Infection in India. Dr Ramakrishnan said the SC ruling was likely to give legal backing to the biases of some healthcare professionals and fuel their discriminatory attitudes.The Anti Retroviral Therapy centre in the Government General Hospital in Chennai had seen a rise in gay patients with HIV coming to them for treatment after the Delhi HC verdict in 2009. “The number MSMs approaching NGOs doubled from 4% to 8%,” said a senior doctor at the hospital.Bhavana, programme manager of Sahodaran, a male sexual health project, said: “If homosexuality is legalised, we can freely distribute condoms to same sex couples. It would have also encouraged people to come out. This verdict will have a negative impact on intervention programmes.”(With inputs from Kamini Mathai, Madhavi Rajadhyaksha, Durgesh Nandan Jha)","['hivaids', 'blow', 'hiv', 'msms', 'verdict', 'body', 'patients', 'delhi', 'sex', 'hc', 'health', 'fight', 'gay']","Some of the challenges underscored were thankfully overcome owing to the Delhi HC ruling in 2009 decriminalising gay sex.

Will this mean that the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) would require dropping this huge and vulnerable population group out of their future plans?

Though that type of treatment was useful to bring down the number of births of HIV-positive babies, the Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TANSACS) that decided to eradicate it completely, made a change in the treatment method. As per the new method, the Nevirapine tablets should be taken by HIV-positive mothers for 14 weeks during pregnancy and the babies should be given Nevirapine syrup for at least six months.Dr Manivannan, medical officer of the ART centre in Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH), Trichy said that the new regimen of treatment was proved to be effective to ensure the birth of HIV-negative babies born to HIV-positive mothers. ""We work towards achieving the target of nil birth of HIV-positive babies in 2015. We hope it will be possible to reach the target with the present mode of treatment to the HIV-positive mothers.

Manipur's Surachanpur and Bishnupur districts have the highest number of people carrying the Hepatitis-C virus (HCV), with prevalence rates among the districts' IDUs being nearly 90 per cent and 78 per cent respectively.In Nagaland's Wokha and Phek districts, the prevalence rate, as per an Integrated Bio Behavioural Assessment Round 2 Testing, conducted in 2009 by the Indian Council of Medical Research and others, was 20.8 per cent and 8.7 per cent respectively. Prior studies showed that in Manipur, the prevalence rate of HCV is 55 to 80 per cent among IDUs, as opposed to 22 to 33 per cent HIV prevalence among them.""The main objective is to create awareness about viral Hepatitis in the region. The epidemic is at our doorstep, with people getting infected, testing positive and some deaths being reported. However, NGOs and the government continue to ignore the spread of the disease,"" said Ketho, general secretary of Hepatitis Coalition of Nagaland (HEPCON).With much of the focus being restricted to HIV-AIDS and cancer awareness, HCV often escapes attention. With no proper cure or vaccine, course-related HCV treatment is also considered too expensive. People with HCV are prone to develop chronicity that can lead to liver damages. Research show that close to 75 to 85 per cent HCV patients develop chronicity, as opposed to Hepatitis-B patients (HBV).""Intravenous drug users are the most vulnerable. HCV prevalence is much higher than that of HIV. This indicates that there is a bigger pool of HCV patients among IDUs,"" said Gajendra Kumar Medhi, doctor and scientist with the Indian Council of Medical Research.Another factor responsible for the high prevalence of HCV amongst IDUs is needle-sharing. Even with efforts to promote safe injecting practices, the prevalence of needle-sharing is quite high. Users may lessen sharing of syringes, but indirect sharing is widely practiced. Nearly 50 to 70 per cent IDUs admitted to sharing accessories like common containers for drug preparation, filter cotton and rinse water.","['hcv', 'sharing', 'idus', 'cent', 'hiv', 'virus', 'prevalence', 'patients', 'drug', 'bigger', 'medical', 'districts', 'hepatitisc', 'northeast', 'epidemic', 'users']","Prior studies showed that in Manipur, the prevalence rate of HCV is 55 to 80 per cent among IDUs, as opposed to 22 to 33 per cent HIV prevalence among them.

We cannot even buy the drugs from outside given the steep cost,” he complained.Patients are livid that while other four ART centres—in Nagpur, Aurangabad, Pune and Sangli—have dealt with the medicine shortage by procuring them locally, the same zeal was lacking at JJ, which has been accused of inadequate supply of drugs for the last six months.

632,17-3-2014,['Pratiksha Ramkumar'],https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg,"COIMBATORE: A day after a private hospital in Race Course in the city refused to treat a 16-year-old boy further because he was HIV positive, NGOs working with HIV positive patients said almost 98% of private institutions in the city reject patients if they are HIV infected.Kamakshi (name changed), 43, a house-wife who was HIV positive had to undergo a simple colonoscopy because her physician advised her to do so after she complained of chronic stomach pain. She approached a mid-level hospital in Sundarapuram and got her admission form done. However, when she told the staff that she was HIV positive, they returned her admission and claimed they had too many patients lined up for colonoscopy for the next two days and didn't have a vacant bed even in the general ward. ""They asked me to a call three days later or better approach a government hospital for the test,"" she said.The Coimbatore Positive Network, a city-based NGO, said the polite rejection that Kamakshi received was better than usual. ""Almost all private hospitals in the city and surrounding districts refuse to treat or operate on HIV patients,"" said the network's president M Somesh. ""They tell patients that they don't have facilities or infrastructure to treat HIV positive people,"" he said. They tell them to go to government hospitals in Coimbatore or Pollachi, he added.A campaign by the network sensitization programmes held by Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS), three large hospitals have agreed to treat and operate HIV patients. ""We have got them to conduct around 15 deliveries so far,"" says Somesh. However, these hospitals charge HIV patients twice the amount they take from regular patients. ""They claim they have to purchase disposable instruments and gear such as gloves, masks, costumes which they have to dispose after one use and hence the higher charge,"" said Somesh. But we are glad that they at least treat us, so we have learned to bear the costs, he said.Though Coimbatore district has more than 10,300 registered HIV positive patients, the two government hospitals and one link centre are the only venues where a patient can get Anti retroviral therapy (ART) at subsidised rate. ""Even if other private hospitals offer ART, they do not tell us. In fact, hospitals that treat HIV positive patients do not want it to be known,"" said Somesh.Hospitals said they can't be blamed, because ART medication is expensive and the general public is scared of being treated along-side HIV positive patients. ""We have a separate wing to treat HIV patients, conduct surgeries and even do deliveries. We do not publicise it much because we do not want our general patients to live in fear of a transfusion mistake or infection,"" said a doctor at one of the hospitals that treat HIV patients. ""We do not want doctors to lose out on their normal patients,"" he added.Surprisingly, not a single complaint has been filed against any hospital for rejecting a HIV positive patient. ""We have not got any such complaints against a hospital so far,"" said Dr A S Valan, regional coordinator, TANSACS. ""When we get such a complaint we will refer it to the Indian Medical Association and sensitise the particular hospital,"" he says. The law clearly mentions that HIV patients can't be discriminated against.IMA officials said many hospitals refuse HIV patients not because they intend to discriminate but simply because ""they lack the expertise to treat them"". ""Treatment of HIV patients is becoming a specialty on its own. For example, you need to understand the stage of the virus and there are drugs which can't be prescribed along with ART drugs,"" said IMA state president Dr M Balasubramanian.This is a far cry from Chennai where almost all big hospitals have started treating HIV patients. ""We haven't got any complaints from our members about being turned away from a hospital, despite them being very poor,"" says S Noori, president, South India Positive Network.","['private', 'coimbatore', 'hospital', 'hiv', 'patients', 'treat', 'refuse', 'positive', 'hospitals', 'art', 'tell']","""Almost all private hospitals in the city and surrounding districts refuse to treat or operate on HIV patients,"" said the network's president M Somesh.

Not just ill-informed and superstitious Khap Panchayats but even our educated and intelligent health service providers have apparently added a fifth 'varna' to our patriarchal, parochial, and stratified society. At the very bottom of the heap are the new untouchables - those who are denied c-sections, gallbladder and other surgical interventions, those who can't get broken bones mended - children, women, and men testing positive for HIV The first-ever survey conducted by HIV positive people (also called PLHA) on HIV positive people in Patna came to light recently. So much is the fear of being ostracized that 50% of those surveyed haven't disclosed their status to their family while 77% haven't disclosed their status to close friends. While 5% lost their share of property, 2% of the women were thrown out of their homes. As many as 34% of those employed face problems at the workplace after their HIV status became known. However, the majority of the survey sample consisted of those in the informal sector.The Community Health Medicinal Unit (CHMU) presented their findings on issues and problems of people with HIV and AIDS in a consultation attended by prominent members of the HIV/AIDS fraternity, including representatives from state government bodies, NGOs, doctors, lawyers and so on. The report reflected the growing anxiety of PLHA and their families about the denial of surgical procedures and treatment by government doctors, some incidents of which have been highlighted in the local media.By and large, BSACS ( Bihar State AIDS Control Society ) and the state government have ensured regular and timely dispensing of ART (antiretroviral therapy) medicines that PLHA need with 94% of the survey respondents giving positive responses about the facilities available in Patna (PMCH and RMRI). But no PLHA gets treatment for opportunistic infections from the PHCs (primary health centres). Greater coordination is needed between BSACS, government and civil society to address issues that go beyond the mere distribution of free medicines.""Doctors belong to the educated and enlightened section of our society, but there are among them (those) who practice untouchability vis-à-vis persons with HIV,"" said the report. The doctors attending the event claimed there were orthopaedic surgeons and gynaecologists in the city who have never refused to operate on patients with HIV, but these can be counted on the finger of one hand, says Chandy Joseph of CHMU.The conference recognized that surgeons fear contracting HIV by coming into contact with infected body fluids during operative procedures, and government hospitals are not provided good quality protective gear. It strongly recommended that the government supply adequate protective kits to surgical departments to deal with this issue.Doctors Diwakar Tejaswi and A K Singh said the government should turn its attention to upgrading four key factors that impact PLHA and are linked to prejudice against them. These factors include doctors and training programmes, availability of post-prick prophylaxis, availability of protection kits and care and nursing services training for serving PLHA.The doctors recommended that the government should conduct trainings and orientations for medical service providers and paramedics on how to provide services to PLHA, and enlist as resource persons surgeons such as Dr John Mukhopadhyay, Dr Manoj Kumar and others who regularly perform surgical interventions for PLHA so that there could be a sharing of ideas that will lead to a reduction in stigma and discrimination.The conference also recommended that PLHA should be entitled to BPL status and accorded the entitlements by virtue of their condition in the spirit of the Supreme Court judgments. This status could be provided on the basis of the ART card. Special efforts should be made to ensure that the Right to Education Act norms of elementary education effectively covers children with HIV.The positive attitude of the representatives of the PLHA attending the conference was remarkable. ""Yes, many of us face discrimination, even abuse, but we are not here to point fingers. Let's educate each other, understand our fears, and engage with civil society and government more actively,"" said Sanjeet Singh, the person who has successfully used the PIL route to bring relief to affected members of the PLHA community.","['society', 'hiv', 'doctors', 'positive', 'survey', 'untouchables', 'plha', 'surgeons', 'state', 'surgical', 'status']","At the very bottom of the heap are the new untouchables - those who are denied c-sections, gallbladder and other surgical interventions, those who can't get broken bones mended - children, women, and men testing positive for HIV The first-ever survey conducted by HIV positive people (also called PLHA) on HIV positive people in Patna came to light recently.

Instead, they tied the knot, and thanks to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) their child is HIV negative.For Melvin and Janet D'Souza, both also HIV positive , the tying of the knot happened 30 years ago. They chose not to have children.NGOs working towards enlightening society on the humane treatment of those with HIV say more and more people with AIDS in Goa are taking the plunge into marriage.""Loneliness and lack of companionship often lead to neglect of one's health, so having a partner does create an environment for a better future and longer life,"" says Maria Cardoso, project officer at Udant.Anita Pereira, also with the NGO, says, ""Many who have HIV initially have doubts about getting married, but, HIV does not prevent anyone from marrying, it only requires a little more responsibility and trust from both people in the relationship.""Medications, new infections, family issues and failing health burden HIV-positive couples everyday. Yet they stand by each other, fighting tough.Catherine, who contributes to the family income by selling vegetables she grows, says the couple has ""abundant worries"". ""We have short lives.

""Honesty,"" she says, ""Is the most important thing you can bring to the table. And tolerance. And letting people grow at their own pace."" There's also learning how to argue.

Of late, both doctors and nurses in Trichy hospitals are alert to HIV risks from patients undergoing surgery. There have been cases where HIV-positive women who were admitted for delivery or caesarean didn't disclose their health condition fearing discrimination. To be on the safer side, doctors are now insisting on HIV tests for all surgery cases.Sources said two HIV-positive pregnant women got admitted at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH) for emergency delivery in October and December last year. Only after completing the surgery, doctors came to know that they were HIV-infected. ""A nurse fainted after knowing that the blood scattered on her during the delivery was of an HIV-infected woman.

But based on our studies of blood samples collected from 17 patients, we found that for 150mg of rifabutin to work, patients would have to take the drug every day,” said Dr Geetha Ramachandran, who led the study.The subjects of the study were all patients at Government Hospital of Thoracic Medicine, Tambaram. All of them had failed to respond to first-line treatment.Researchers found that the RNTCP stipulated dosage administered to seven patients was too low to counter the disease. Four of the subjects died during the course of the study.“Ten of the patients, who received a dosage of around 30mg/ml higher than that prescribed by the RNTCP, showed favourable response to the treatment,” Dr Ramachandran said.Experts say the dosage of the drug has always been a matter of debate, with doctors exercising extra caution due to possible chemical interaction of medicines for HIV and TB.“While in some countries like the US, the dosage of rifabutin has been increased from 150mg three days a week to the same amount daily, in India insufficient data and studies resulted in health authorities failing to increase the dosage,” NIRT director Soumya Swaminathan said.The researchers have presented the results of the study to the National AIDS Control Organisation. “A multi-centric study will be undertaken in different parts of the country to assess the effect of rifabutin. This could change the drug regimen for HIV-positive patients with TB,” Dr Swaminathan said.Experts say 60%-70% of HIV-infected patients are likely to develop TB, mostly those on second-line therapy.“There are several factors that may lead to poor treatment outcome, including malnutrition and other infections. The dosage of rifabutin, which kills the bacteria, is also a contributing factor which can’t be taken lightly. Although we recommend daily dosage, more studies will be required to determine the optimal level,” Dr Ramachandran said.","['reveals', 'hiv', 'counter', 'drug', 'patients', 'rntcp', 'dr', 'key', 'study', 'low', 'studies', 'dosage', 'tuberculosis', 'tb', 'rifabutin']","All of them had failed to respond to first-line treatment.Researchers found that the RNTCP stipulated dosage administered to seven patients was too low to counter the disease.

The decision has been taken to promote birth of HIV-free children.The Rajasthan State Aids Control Society (RSACS) has initiated lifelong multi-drug antiretroviral (ARV) regimens for all pregnant and breast-feeding women living with HIV. The transmission of HIV from infected mother to her newborn is one of the leading causes of spread of HIV. According to RSACS, it is estimated that 5.2% of total HIV infections are due to transmission of HIV from mother to newborn.To deal with it, earlier the RSACS was providing single dose of Nevirapine to such women at the time of labour pain to prevent the HIV transmission from mother to her newborn baby. But, from May 19, the RSACS has changed its strategy.Health department's project director (AIDS) Dr SS Chauhan said, ""From an HIV infected mother, the risk of vertical transmission of HIV to newborn is 30%. But, a single dose of Nevirapine reduces the risk to around 15%. So far we were giving single dose of Nevirapine to pregnant women at the time of delivery. But, still the high risk (up to 15%) remained the cause of concern for us. Now, to bring down the percentage of risk of vertical transmission of HIV from mother to her newborn, we have initiated the lifelong ART (triple drug regimen). The multidrug ARV regimen would further decrease the risk from 11% to up to 5%. It will be the major benefit of the new multidrug regimen.""The triple drug regimen includes — Tenofovir, Lamivudine and Efavirenz. The three drugs would be administered to the women living with HIV and her infant. The drug would continue lifelong to reduce mortality and morbidity in mothers and children.The RSACS is spreading awareness of HIV testing among pregnant women. They take consent of pregnant women for HIV testing. If the women test positive for HIV, they link the women with anti retroviral therapy centre. Also, they put effort to prevent the transmission of HIV to her newborn.In 2013-14, the RSACS conducted HIV testing on 4.68 lakh pregnant women and found 412 women living with HIV. In 2012-13, the RSACS had tested 3.86lakh pregnant women and found 383 of them living with HIV. They have linked the newborns with antiretroviral therapy centres.

The drug would continue lifelong to reduce mortality and morbidity in mothers and children.The RSACS is spreading awareness of HIV testing among pregnant women.
Also, they put effort to prevent the transmission of HIV to her newborn.In 2013-14, the RSACS conducted HIV testing on 4.68 lakh pregnant women and found 412 women living with HIV.",2

Hence, we are not inclined to confirm the death sentence.""On March 26, 2013, the district and sessions court at Islampur had convicted and sentenced him to death for raping and murdering the girl. The victim, a resident of Sangli, was studying in standard two in a local school.The prosecution's case is that on February 26, 2011, the man had taken the girl from school to Kalammawadi, near Kasegaon in Walva tehsil and raped her in a sugarcane field. He then strangled her and fled to Pune. When the girl did not come back from school, her mother told her husband.He inquired with the school teacher who had told him that she had gone with her maternal uncle. After a search, the girl's father registered a criminal case with the Kasegaon police station.The rapist was arrested after investigations revealed his involvement in the crime. The victim's body was recovered from the sugarcane field.The trial court had sentenced him to death under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). He was sentenced to life imprisonment for rape under section 376 (2) (f) of the IPC. He was also sentenced to three years' rigorous imprisonment each for kidnapping and destroying evidence under sections 363 and 201 of the IPC.The trial court had sent a reference to the high court for confirming the death sentence. He had also filed a criminal appeal challenging the death sentence in the high court.Additional public prosecutor Mankuwar Deshmukh relied on aggravating circumstances to prove that the accused had brutally raped and murdered a defenceless girl. She pleaded to confirm death sentence as the girl was last seen in the company of the accused.She relied on the DNA report to prove that the blood stains found on the victim's frock matched his blood group. She submitted that the rapist was a habitual offender as he had two cases registered against him with the Chinchwad police station here in 2009 and 2011. The HC later found that he had been acquitted in both the cases.The HC appointed lawyer Abhaykumar Apte to represent the man from its legal aid committee. Apte argued that police had not recorded his statement to show that the dead body was recovered at his instance.He also challenged the identification parade of the accused on the grounds that the witnesses had seen him at the police station.The HC's observations Quoting several Supreme Court judgments, the HC bench said, ""The man was suffering from HIV and this was the only mitigating circumstance in his favour for commuting his death sentence to life imprisonment.""The HC also sought his doctor's advice on whether his life span will be that of an ordinary man if he continued with the medicines. While partly allowing his appeal, the HC on examining the evidence maintained his conviction under sections of the IPC, but commuted the death sentence given for murder to life imprisonment.The HC also commuted the life imprisonment awarded for rape to 10 years RI. However, both the sentences will run consecutively. The sentences of three years RI each awarded for kidnapping and destruction of evidence will run concurrently.

Repeat viral load blood testing performed 72 hours later confirmed this finding (10,564 copies/mL of virus).Additionally, the child had decreased levels of CD4+ T-cells, a key component of a normal immune system, and the presence of HIV antibodies — signals of an actively replicating pool of virus in the body.The child was again started on ART. Genetic sequencing of the virus indicated that the child’s HIV infection was the same strain acquired from the mother.Delegates pray for individuals that have perished due to HIV-AIDS at the 31st International AIDS Candlelight Memorial in Manila (Getty Images)The child continues to receive medical care, treatment and monitoring from Hannah Gay, a pediatric HIV specialist at the University of Mississippi Medical Center who has been involved in the child’s care since birth.Researchers say they will now work to better understand what enabled the child to remain off treatment for more than two years without detectable virus or measurable immunologic response and what might be done to extend the period of sustained HIV remission in the absence of ART.“The fact that this child was able to remain off antiretroviral treatment for two years and maintain quiescent virus for that length of time is unprecedented,” said Deborah Persaud, professor of infectious diseases at the John Hopkins Children’s Center in Baltimore and one of the two pediatric HIV experts involved in the ongoing analysis of the case. “Typically, when treatment is stopped, HIV levels rebound within weeks, not years”.Quilts embroidered with the names of AIDS victims (Getty Images)“The case of the Mississippi child indicates that early antiretroviral treatment in this HIV-infected infant did not completely eliminate the reservoir of HIV-infected cells that was established upon infection but may have considerably limited its development and averted the need for antiretroviral medication over a considerable period,” said Dr Fauci.“Now we must direct our attention to understanding why that is and determining whether the period of sustained remission in the absence of therapy can be prolonged even further.”HIV first sprung its head over 30 years ago and has till now infected over 34 million people worldwide.Finding a vaccine against HIV has been a daunting challenge.The UN estimates that 330,000 babies were infected in 2011. This is apart from more than three million children living with HIV around the world.In India, more than 14,000 children got infected in 2011, which accounted for 13% decline compared to 2009. The number of estimated deaths among children (0-14 years old) due to AIDS was 10,213 in 2011.In India, children accounted for 7% of an estimated 21 lakh people living with HIV/AIDS in 2011. Around 40% (8.16 lakh) of them were women, who are likely to pass on the virus to their children.The baby in question was born prematurely in a Mississippi clinic in 2010 to an HIV-infected mother who did not receive ART medication during pregnancy and was not diagnosed with HIV infection until the time of delivery. Because of the high risk of HIV exposure, the infant was started at 30 hours of age on liquid, triple-drug antiretroviral treatment. Testing confirmed within several days that the baby had been infected with HIV. At two weeks of age, the baby was discharged from the hospital and continued on liquid antiretroviral therapy.The baby continued on antiretroviral treatment until 18 months of age, when the child was lost to follow up and no longer received treatment. Yet, when the child was again seen by medical staff five months later, blood samples revealed undetectable HIV levels (less than 20 copies of HIV per milliliter of blood (copies/mL)) and no HIV-specific antibodies. The child continued to do well in the absence of antiretroviral medicines and was free of detectable HIV for more than two years.“The prolonged lack of viral rebound, in the absence of HIV-specific immune responses, suggests that the very early therapy not only kept this child clinically well, but also restricted the number of cells harboring HIV infection,” said Katherine Luzuriaga, professor of molecular medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.A Global Plan on HIV has two main targets for 2015: a 90% reduction in the number of children newly infected with HIV and a 50% reduction in the number of AIDS-related maternal deaths. The Plan focuses on the 22 countries which account for 90% of new HIV infections among children which includes India.","['miracle', 'girl', 'infected', 'blow', 'hiv', 'suffering', 'virus', 'antiretroviral', 'massive', 'cured', 'treatment', 'child', 'medical', 'infection', 'children', 'levels', 'baby']","“Scientifically, this development reminds us that we still have much more to learn about the intricacies of HIV infection and where the virus hides in the body”.A routine clinical care visit earlier this month has revealed that the child has detectable HIV levels in the blood (16,750 copies/mL).

667,17-7-2014,[],https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg,"With the issue of HIV related stigma and discrimination being addressed in the state, I have attempted to put more light on the issue. There is need to understand the issue, not only in relation to the children who are facing discrimination, but close to 14,000 odd HIVpositive individuals found positive in Goa. Rivona case should help us to strategize for a long term impact.Goa had set an example to the rest of country three decades ago and had created an impact in addressing HIV-related stigma and discrimination. India's first HIV litigation arose when HIVpositive activist Dominic D'Souza was incarcerated in the late 1980s. D'Souza, a resident of Goa, was found to be HIVpositive when he donated blood at a Goa hospital. The test was performed without his knowledge or consent, and the results were revealed not to him, but to the local police.D'Souza was subsequently arrested and confined in an unused TB sanatorium pursuant to the Goa, Daman and Diu Public Health Act, 1985, an amendment to which in 1986 authorized the state to mandatorily test any person for HIV and isolate them if they tested HIVpositive.He challenged the Goa Public Health Amendment Act, which called for mandatory isolation of an HIVpositive person. He won a partial victory when the court ruled detainment was mandatory only in a ""justifiable"" case. His legacy continues through Positive, the NGO he started to help people living with HIV.Dominic's case highlighted several aspects of the laws that are related to the HIV epidemic beyond the application (or mis-application) of public health laws. Dominic was tested for HIV without his consent, his confidentiality was breached, and eventually, when he was released, he had lost his job.Since that first case, violations of the rights of people living with or affected by HIV have increasingly come to light, many legal cases have been fought and won or lost, and many judgments have been pronounced by the courts.It should be understood that those who stigmatize people living with HIV falsely believe that the virus is highly contagious and that they could easily become infected. When that happens, others start to view HIV-positive as a threat. Many become isolated - within their homes, in public, at their workplaces. They are further stigmatized by others' assumptions about their moral integrity - such as the belief that they became infected with HIV because they chose to take part in risky behaviors.Also, stigma and discrimination continue to undermine prevention, treatment and care of people living with the HIV and AIDS. It hinders those with the virus from telling their partners about their status. It threatens their access to health care. It increases their vulnerability to physical violence. And HIV-related stigma affects people's ability to earn a living, making it even more difficult for them to lift themselves out of poverty.HIV and AIDS have highlighted such vast inequities, violent abuse and widespread stigma, that human rights have been violated in a manner and on a scale rarely witnessed before in the public health sphere. The HIV epidemic cannot be looked upon as just a medical problem. It touches on the most personal behaviours and aspects of people's lives, and its effect is felt in every sphere of a person's life. Combating it therefore demands an approach that integrates social, cultural, economic and human rights perspectives.While we discuss this, I wish to bring to fore more issues related to this. Once an adolescent finds out about his or her HIV status, disclosure, safer sex and family planning become pressing issues, requiring services tailored to the specific needs of adolescents. Despite the growing importance of this population group, they are largely left out of HIV/AIDS responses in the state. One effect is that existing paediatric and adult services are often ill-equipped to deal with their complex needs.This emerging situation underscores the need to recognize these adolescents in Goa as well, learn more about their lives, identify their preventive information needs and service priorities, and design appropriate programs for their special needs. Civil society organizations and the state at large, need to have planned and sustainable programmes for children, rather address issues as they come to the fore.While, I highlight the above, I also wish to bring to the attention of public at large, some of the instances of stigma and discrimination faced by people living with HIV in Goa. Discrimination in medical setting is widely prevalent. Surprisingly, even I came across staff of an NGO working in the premises of GMC to provide services, identifying HIV patients and alerting others to maintain distance. Some who are availing 50% bus concession from KTC also face discrimination by conductors who sometimes grill them on the card and also deny them concession. Most of the migrant PLHIVs, including children are denied social entitlement and social security schemes. People accessing DSS schemes are constantly under fear and sometimes refrain from accessing schemes due to fear of status being revealed.The government besides providing some social entitlements should also focus on long term HIV impact mitigation. It's high time that all stakeholders working to address HIV in the state come together on a common platform and address HIV through need-based, planned and sustained programmes. It requires commitment, courage and leadership at all levels.(The writer is the founder of Human Touch and secretary of Positive People.

On World Hepatitis Day on Monday, World Health Organization called for using similar strategies and infrastructure to check the spread of infection caused by Hepatitis viruses.The issue was discussed at the first roundtable consultation on viral hepatitis organized by WHO at Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences ""The HIV/AIDS programme in India has been successful mainly because of its robust sentinel surveillance mechanism, involvement of community health workers and NGOs to spread awareness and availability of free drugs. These strategies and infrastructure can be used to spread awareness about Hepatitis B and C that follow similar modes of transmission,"" said Dr Nicole Seguy, technical advisor at the WHO country office.There are five main hepatitis viruses, of which B and C cause the most fatalities as these can lead to liver cirrhosis and cancer. Dr Seguy said preventive measures such as compulsory vaccination for Hepatitis B, promoting safe sex and screening of blood for infections at the time of transfusion can help check the spread of diseases.""Though there is treatment available for Hepatitis C , few can afford it. The government should make efforts to subsidize or make drugs available for free to those infected,"" she added.Dr S K Sarin, director of ILBS, said a key recommendation made by the experts group at the WHO meet was that the government should utilize services of 17,000 HIV surveillance centres for screening Hepatitis B and C patients. ""If one person in the family has Hepatitis B, chances of others having it are high. It is important to screen them for the virus before vaccination because the vaccines can only protect uninfected patients,"" he said.Nata Menabde, WHO representative to India, also stressed on the need for reliable information on viral hepatitis for building prevention and control measures. ""WHO calls upon all partners and stakeholders to make the 'silent' epidemic of viral hepatitis more visible and more manageable,"" she said.""We have had massive awareness campaigns for polio, HIV or tuberculosis in our country. Hepatitis is also one such disease which can be prevented to a large extent if people know about it,"" said Dr S K Acharya, HOD, gastroenterology, at AIIMS.

These girls now believe that they are not just patients but also human beings,” says Savani. He has even named his farmhouse ‘Janani Dham’.

But with limited budget they had no other option than to ask government for accommodation facility.After Savani offered his farmhouse, these girls have a sprawling garden and a play area equipped with a couple of rides for their recreation.“Living in a lush green area has helped create positivity among them and it has improved their health. No major infections as well as improvements in CD4 count reflect their healthy condition. They can now access good education and meet other citizens regularly,” says Daksha Patel, vice-president of GSNP+.Savani is now planning to accommodate HIV+ widows at the same farmhouse.“If things move ahead as planned, we will soon support HIV+ women by offering them home at ‘Janani Dham’.

The boy rushes to the doctor's chamber, takes his coat and runs back. The doctor and nurse rush behind him. Back with mom, the child says he resorted to the ?theft' just to bring his mother's case to the doctor's notice.Has the message percolated down to the doctors? Apparently not. A 45-year old HIV+ woman died at the PMCH after being denied surgery to remove intestinal obstruction in September last year. Amid much hue and cry, the state health department promised a slew of reforms to ensure people with HIV were not denied healthcare for their other ailments, but they seem to have remained on paper. Even the Patna high court's prods in this regard have gone in vain.Had it not been so, 45-yr-old Ram Kumar would not have been made to run from pillar to post ? from IGIMS to NMCH to PMCH, to be precise ? to get his urethra dilated. More than ten visits to these government healthcare facilities notwithstanding, Kumar remains untreated.It was on August 4, 2009 that Kumar visited the IGIMS' urology department for the first time. Investigations were conducted on him. ""However, when it was discovered that I am HIV positive, I was told to go away. As my condition deteriorated, I visited the hospital again after four days. They again said it was not possible to operate me at the IGIMS,"" he said.As the complications increased, Kumar visited a private doctor. He prescribed treatment for a year but the surgery became a must. Kumar went to the NMCH in December 2013. He was refused surgery there too and was instead ""referred to PMCH/IGIMS.""To try his luck for the third time, the patient went to the IGIMS again and found history repeating itself. ""The machine through which the operation is done is not functional,"" Kumar quoted the same doctor as telling him this time.In July this year, Kumar went to the PMCH which referred him to the IGIMS. ""I have lost all hopes. The private doctor says it is high time I got operated upon. If I die, who will be responsible for my death?"" Kumar asked TOI on Friday.The doctors Kumar visited have written ""HIV+"" in bold letters on the top on his prescriptions despite the fact that the treatment protocol prohibits such ?announcements'. All that the doctors can write on such prescriptions is ?PLWHA' which stands for people living with HIV/AIDS.Kumar's is not a one-off case. Raja Singh of Chhoti Pahaari at Patna has been endlessly waiting for a heart surgery. He even visited a private hospital where the doctors told him he should go to the PMCH since his was an HIV case.

Intermittently, he was referred to AIIMS, Safdarjung Hospital and G B Pant Hospital (all in Delhi).Gyan Ranjan, a social activist who has been taking cudgels on behalf of the people with HIV, says he gets 30 to 40 calls from such patients every week. They are denied surgeries ranging from uterus removal to orthopaedic restoration. A patient was denied endoscopy at PMCH last year, he said.According to Ranjan, doctors at times frighten away the patients by cooking up stories. ""Two months back, a 40-yr-old woman of Chhapra went to the PMCH to get her stone problem treated. Doctors told her she would die on the operation table and she returned without treatment. Such cases are common in orthopaedic department too,"" Ranjan said.""After the death of a woman last year, the PMCH administration promised it would allot an operation theatre for two days a week for surgery of people living with HIV.

Tenofovir, in certain instances, is also used as a combination drug in the second-line therapy.One of the affected patients told TOI that major centres at BYL Nair and Sion hospitals too do not have these drugs. “The shortage that started with bigger centres has now hit even the smaller centers at MT Agarwal Hospital in Mulund and Siddharth Hospital in Goregaon, who too have run out of medicines for the past one week now,” he said. “Without ART medicines, most HIV patients may fall sick as their viral load will increase,” he said.Another patient said hospitals like JJ in Byculla and KEM in Parel are the only ones with some stock. “They too are giving the drugs only for a week,” he said. “There is no word from the authorities, including the Mumbai District Aids Control Society or Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS) as to when the medicines will arrive,” he added.Head of medicine at KEM Hospital Dr A R Pazare said that they had stocks, which should last for about a month or two.

Yes and no.The state recorded a marked decline in incidence of HIV infection and deaths from AIDS between 2009 and 2013 among both men and women. However, in what is both a pointer to the vulnerability of the third gender and an indictment of a failure in social inclusiveness, the mortality rate of HIV-positive transgenders in the state increased by more than 1,600% over the same period. Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TNSACS) statistics, sourced by TOI through an RTI petition, show that 1,537 men and 814 women died of HIV/AIDS-related causes in 2009. Effective intervention by the state led to a decline in the numbers to 1,323 male and 595 female HIV/AIDS deaths in 2013, a fall of 18.42%.Tamil Nadu — one of the four worst HIV/AIDS affected states along with Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra — recorded only seven transgender deaths in 2009. The number climbed exponentially to 113 in 2013.If this does not appear to be strikingly high number, consider that the latest census statistics put the number of transgenders in the country at 4.9 lakh out of a total population in excess of 120 crore. That is 0.04% of the general population. By comparison, the HIV/AIDS mortality rate for transgenders by population in Tamil Nadu is 5.56%.Also, activists say, the actual numbers could be far higher because transgender deaths are hugely underreported.""Social stigma prevents the reporting of transgender deaths,"" says A J Hariharan, founder of NGO Indian Community Welfare Organisation , which works for the welfare of the sex workers and transgenders. According to the TNSACS data, the number of HIV-positive cases in the state dropped from 25,572 in 2009 to 17,055 in 2013, with the number of HIV-infected males decreasing from 14,835 to 9,868 and women from 10,665 to 7,127 over the same period.The figures raise several disconcerting questions. Have Tamil Nadu's highly acclaimed efforts to stem the spread of the disease not been an unqualified success? Is social inclusiveness a myth when it comes to transgenders despite several government initiatives to bring the community into the mainstream?Tamil Nadu was the first state to create a special welfare board for transgenders and provide them land, pension and separate ration cards. The Election Commission in 2009 created a separate entry for transgenders on voter lists. But transgenders say the welfare board has ceased to function.""It was after Tamil Nadu that other states like Maharashtra set up welfare board for transgenders. But unfortunately the board for all purposes does not exist,"" says R Jeeva, founder of NGO Transgender Rights Association and a former member of the welfare board.Other officials say lack of awareness is probably the main cause for the rise in deaths of transgenders. ""The increase in deaths of HIV-positive transgenders is a concern. It is most likely linked to unsafe sex,"" said Dr Vijaya Raman, deputy director of Tamil Nadu AIDS Initiative (TAI).But transgenders say they have little choice in the matter. Latha S, a 30-year-old transgender says she's a prostitute by compulsion and not by choice. While that may be true of most women and men who sell sex for money, individuals of the third gender — stigmatised, ridiculed and shunned — have far fewer chances of opting out of the profession than others.Latha says she did not have an education and no one would give her a job. ""I have been in the profession ever since I discovered I was a transgender and joined the community,"" she says. ""Once I left home there was no one to educate me or help me get employed.""Her job, Latha says, involves violence from drunks and rowdies. ""Customers often do not pay and policemen harass us and force us to pay a large chunk of what we earn for protection,"" she says.""I hate being a prostitute but I don't know what else to do,"" she says. What is worst, she says, is the vulnerability that she and other transgenders face and the constant fear it engenders.Transgenders usually leave home when they are around 16 years old, says A J Hariharan, the founder secretary of Indian Community Welfare Organisation (ICWO), an NGO that works for the welfare of the homeless, sex workers and transgenders. ""They join other transgenders and are pushed into begging and prostitution,"" he says. ""Lack of basic education means they are unable to get jobs and the stigma attached to them means even manual labour is not an option.""Hariharan says companies could, as part of their corporate social responsibility programmes, look to help transgenders. ""That would be empowering for members of the community because it would involve acceptance of the fact that transgenders are part of society and bring them into the mainstream, apart from giving them a livelihood,"" he says.But the discrimination that transgenders face leaves them with little optimism that they could win acceptance and integrate with society. ""Social acceptance? I don't know if that is possible,"" says transgender Raji Sekar, 25. ""We can't even take a house on rent because few landlords would want transgenders as tenants.""""I did not wish to be transgender,"" she says. ""I was born this way and that is what people should realise for society to accept us,"" she says.Her companion Ambika M, has bruises on her face and hands. She says a group of men beat her up a few days ago. ""We face intolerance all the time, so nobody cares about our safety,"" she says.

The commission’s chairperson Samira Kazi said the department is exploring other possibilities of taking action against Prabhudessai.When contacted by STOI, Prabhudessai refused to reveal what he had advised the villagers, saying only, “I’m responsible for the welfare of my village.” Asked if he had misinformed locals about HIV/AIDS, he said he would reply only to an inquiry against him.Chief minister Manohar Parrikar recently assured the legislative assembly that action would be taken against the doctor, after Sanguem MLA Subhash Faldessai raised the issue in the House.Before his retirement, Prabhudessai worked for the directorate of health services and also served in the armed forces. Post retirement he runs a private practice at Colomb, Rivona. Asked if he is open to the idea of children with HIV being given admissions in regular schools, Prabhudessai said, “It is a debatable issue.” He refused to elaborate, saying he did not want to answer such questions telephonically.He informed STOI that he was registered with the Maharashtra Medical Council after getting his degree, as the Goa council did not exist then, and later he did register with the Goa council. It is mandatory for every doctor to register with the state medical council or MCI if they want to practice in India. It is also compulsory for doctors to renew this registration every five years.The controversy over admissions to HIV-positive children raged for over a fortnight in June-July, and was finally resolved through government intervention. It saw over 40 parents withdraw their wards from the school where the children with HIV were finally admitted.","['gets', 'misinformed', 'breather', 'council', 'hiv', 'rivona', 'village', 'medical', 'action', 'panel', 'prabhudessai', 'state', 'locals', 'goa', 'children', 'medico', 'admissions', 'doctor']","Post retirement he runs a private practice at Colomb, Rivona.

The ministry data shows that in neighbouring states like Maharashtra and Karnataka, where a larger number of women were screened, the percentage of women testing positive was significantly lower. It has been estimated that a mother has 30 per cent chance of transmitting the virus to her baby during pregnancy.

More than one-third of them, or 7.5 lakh patients, are on the public health programme this year. While the medicines are available in the retail market at a cost, the ones dispensed at government-owned centres come free.At certain centres in Mumbai and Delhi, partial doses of treatment are being provided to patients for a few days, forcing them to return frequently. Alternatively, drugs are being substituted.Hospitals such as AIIMS, Safdarjung and LNJP in Delhi, and Nair, KEM, Siddharth and Sion in Mumbai have been grappling with shortage of these drugs.Prices of first-line HIV drugs in the retail market has come down now substantially due to affordable generic medicines. The treatment costs lakhs of rupees for advanced therapies for certain patients. While, retail first-line drugs cost Rs 5,500 a year, the advanced and complex therapies come at around Rs 20,000 to Rs 2 lakh a year.In a legal notice to the health ministry sent on August 22, the Delhi Network of Positive People (DNP+), representing HIV patients, has sought emergency procurement and relocation of stocks to government-owned centres experiencing stock-outs of ARVS, particularly in Mumbai.

""This is a surprising finding that provides new insights into our understanding of not only HIV infection, but also that of Ebola and other viruses,"" said Shan-Lu Liu, associate professor in the University of Missouri School of Medicine's Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology.AIDS is a condition characterised by progressive failure of the immune system. It is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).When HIV-1 or any virus infects a cell, it replicates and spreads to other cells. One type of cellular protein - T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain, or TIM-1 - has previously been shown to promote entry of some highly pathogenic viruses into host cells.Now, researchers have found that the same protein possesses a unique ability to block the release of HIV-1 and Ebola virus.""This study shows that TIM proteins keep viral particles from being released by the infected cell and instead keep them tethered to the cell surface,"" said Gordon Freeman, associate professor of medicine with Harvard Medical School's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.""This is true for several important enveloped viruses including HIV and Ebola. We may be able to use this insight to slow the production of these viruses,"" said Freeman.Under the supervision of Liu, Minghua Li, a graduate student in the MU Pathobiology Area Programme, performed a series of experiments that revealed the protein's ability to inhibit HIV-1 release, resulting in diminished viral production and replication.HIV-1 attacks cells that are vital to the body's immune system, such as T cells. These white blood cells play an important role in the body's response to infection, but HIV-1 disrupts the cells' ability to fight back against infection.When the virus enters a host cell, it infects the cell and replicates, producing viral particles that spread to and infect other cells.The researchers found that as the viral particles attempt to bud from, or leave, the infected cell, the TIM-family proteins located on the surface of the cell can attach to lipids on the surface of the viral particle.These lipids - known as phosphatidylserine (PS) - are normally present on the inner side of the cellular membrane but can be exposed to the outer side upon viral infection.When the TIM-family proteins come in contact with PS, the viral particle becomes attached to the host cell, keeping the particle from being released from the cell.Because TIM-family proteins and PS are present on the surface of the cell and the viral particle, the viral particles get stuck to one another, forming a network of viral particles that accumulate on the surface of the host cell, rather than being released to infect other cells.The study was published in the journal PNAS.","['hiv1', 'viral', 'release', 'ebola', 'hiv', 'cells', 'viruses', 'identified', 'proteins', 'particles', 'surface', 'host', 'inhibit', 'cell']","WASHINGTON: In a surprise finding, scientists have discovered that a family of proteins that helps viruses, such as HIV and Ebola, enter a cell can also block the release of these deadly viruses.

Shortly afterwards, her husband Binoy (name changed) also tested HIV-positive. Ever since, Binoy’s brother threatened the duo of dire consequences every now and then if they did not leave the house they shared with him.“My brother in-law used to abuse me maligning my character. For the last few years, I have not even shared the common washroom,” she said.“No amount of reasoning would convince him that we were taking all the necessary precautions since we also have a child. He and his wife would abuse and even physically assault us. Finally, on Saturday afternoon, my brother-in-law summoned a few locals who are known to him. After my husband returned from work, they caught hold of him and threw him out of the house. When I rushed to his rescue, one of them hit me on the head with a stick and I started bleeding,” she added.“But nobody in our locality was aware of our disease until yesterday. I am afraid how I will run my family now. I don’t know how our daughter will continue her education either.”The battered couple went to police, who helped them return home. There is now a police picket in the locality in Ghola. But the stigma of social ostracism in an area barely 30km from the city centre is a grim pointer to the taboo that still surrounds the disease.The couple have a six-year-old daughter, who is not HIV-positive. They were making preparations to secure her life when their own blood relatives and one-time friends turned on them. On Sunday, the couple brought back their daughter from an undisclosed location where they had sent her fearing her safety when they were attacked on Saturday.Local residents, however, came to the rescue of the couple.

We plan to hand over some money to the couple by saving it from our Puja funds.”Pappu Roy, a local resident and a third-year student at APC College, said: “I will discuss with my friends how we can stand by them. We will have to first raise their confidence level so that they can live in the mainstream of the society without any sense of shame and fear. However, the question of how they will run their family and manage treatment costs is of utmost importance.”“The couple says they are HIV-positive and that they were beaten up by the husband's brother.

A similar trend has been observed among AIDS patients with only 51 cases registered in 2013 compared to 184 cases registered in 2009. A total of 1,040 persons have succumbed to the deadly virus since 1989, when HIV was first detected in Goa. But, this is only the reported figure, while the actual number would be higher as HIV-related deaths at home or private hospitals are not reflected in the above figures. GSACS project director Dr Vandana Patankar said that they have increased the number of anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centres in Goa. Earlier, there was only one main ART centre at the Goa medical college, Bambolim; but, in recent years, GSACS has set up link ART centres at Asilo hospital, Mapusa, Hospicio hospital, Margao, sub-district hospital, Ponda and cottage hospital, Chicalim.Patankar revealed plans of upgrading the link ART centre at the Hospicio, Margao, to facility-integrated ART centre. This means that there will be a doctor and nurse at the centre and patients from South Goa need not travel to GMC for the initial CD4 test. He also mentioned of another link ART centre that has been approved for the Curchorem community health centre.GSACS has tied up with nine NGOs to execute 16 projects in Goa to combat HIV/AIDS. These NGOs work with high risk groups like commercial sex workers, drug users, gay men, truckers, etc. GSACS is now adding two more projects with the focus on migrants.Another new measure is towards HIV positive pregnant women. Earlier, these women were treated only at the time of delivery. Now, such cases will be provided life-long ART treatment and the child will be given treatment for at least six months depending on whether it is HIV positive or negative. “Presently, the mother to child HIV transmission percentage is about 2.5%. We want to make it zero,” Patankar said.He also informed of another new initiative of setting up a new opiad substitution therapy centre at Hospicio, Margao. This centre is meant to wean drug addicts who use injections from syringes to oral drugs which are less addictive. Presently, there is only one such centre at Calangute which is run by an NGO.GSACS is also adding one more ICTC (integrated counselling and testing centres) at Ponda.

A genetic analysis of thousands of individual viruses has confirmed beyond reasonable doubt that HIV first emerged in Kinshasa, the capital of the Belgian Congo, in about 1920 from where it spread thanks to the colonial railway network to other parts of central Africa.Scientists have nailed the origin of the Aids pandemic to a colonial-era city — then called Leopoldville which was then the biggest urban centre in Central Africa including a market in wild “bush meat” captured from the nearby forests.A “perfect storm” of factors then led to the virus’ spread in the human population.UNAIDS estimates that 35 million people were living with HIV in the world at the end of 2013.Scientists from University of Oxford said, “Thirty years after the discovery of HIV-1, the early transmission, dissemination and establishment of the virus in human populations remain unclear. Using statistical approaches applied to HIV-1 sequence data from central Africa, we show that from the 1920s Kinshasa (in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo) was the focus of early transmission and the source of pre-1960 pandemic viruses elsewhere. Location and dating estimates were validated using the earliest HIV-1 archival sample, also from Kinshasa. Our results reconstruct the early dynamics of HIV-1 and emphasize the role of social changes and transport networks in the establishment of this virus in human populations.”Vendors sell their products beside a railroad track in Kinshasa, Zaire (File photo via Getty Images)The breakthrough was possible due to a new, sophisticated analysis of hundreds of genetic sequences of HIV from different time points and locations.The researchers also note that 13 documented cases exist of different simian viruses jumping from chimpanzees, gorillas and monkeys into humans, but only one — known has HIV-1 group M — sparked a global epidemic. They show that group M and another strain, group O, expanded at the same rate until about 1960, but then group M nearly tripled its rate of spread. Possible reasons include public health campaigns that had contaminated needles and an increase in the number of clients of sex workers.“For the first time we have analysed all the available evidence using the latest phylogeographic techniques, which enable us to statistically estimate where a virus comes from,” said Professor Oliver Pybus of Oxford University. “This means we can say with a high degree of certainty where and when the HIV pandemic originated.”“Kinshasa at that time was growing fast, it was the biggest city in central Africa at that time and was very well connected to the rest of the Congo,” said Nuno Faria of Oxford.“Data from colonial archives tells us that by the end of the 1940s over one million people were travelling through Kinshasa on the railways each year. Our genetic data tells us that HIV very quickly spread across Congo, a country the size of Western Europe,” Dr Faria said.“Our research suggests that following the original animal-to-human transmission of the virus, probably through the hunting or handling of bush meat , there was only a small window during the Belgian colonial era for this particular strain of HIV to emerge and spread into a pandemic,” Professor Pybus said.“By the 1960s, transport systems such as the railways that enabled the virus to spread vast distances were less active, but by that time the seeds of the pandemic were already sown across Africa and beyond,” he said.","['location', 'hiv1', 'kinshasa', 'pandemic', 'hiv', 'viruses', 'scientists', 'pinpointed', 'virus', 'spread', '30', 'congo', 'exact', 'central', 'appearance', 'hivs', 'group', 'africa']","LONDON: Over 30 years after it first emerged and has since infected over 75 million people, scientists have finally pinpointed from where exactly HIV emerged.

According to the department of AIDS control (2013-2014) and as per NACO HIV estimates, the total number of new infected adults was 6,460 and there were 3,594 AIDS related deaths in the northeast region.Organizations working with HIV positive people said that depleting stocks in medicines such as Nevirapine, combined dosages of Tenofovor and Lamivudine, and Abacavir have rendered a section of the adult HIV positive people in some places to use medicines meant for children who are HIV positive.In Manipur, which is considered to have the highest number of HIV positive people in the country (40,855 in March 2012), Nevirapine is almost out of stock, sources said. A 200 mg dose of Nevirapine is taken twice a day by a HIV positive person. With diminishing stocks, patients were reported to be taking Nevirapine 50 mg four times in the morning and four times in the evening.“We cannot live without these drugs. The situation has been going on for a while. We are dependent on these medicines and a timely duration during the present course of the drug regimen keeps our health in check. Authorities should take necessary steps,” said Rajkumar Kanta, president of Community Network for Empowerment (CONE).Besides the shortage, slow dispatch in medicines on the part of courier services has also caused problems.

The dispatch was lying idle for 19 days in Guwahati, sources said.“I took a tracking slip from one courier company for tracking Nevirapine.

That child died four years ago, the home is now a big building closer to Acoi and presently, there are 20 girls and 22 boys living there. Except for seven, all are on anti-retroviral treatment from the Goa medical college. Most of the children are migrants but there are a few Goans from the Vasco area. ASRO takes in children of all creeds and most are non-Christians, except five.“There is a sad story behind every child here,” says Sr Coshav Rodrigues, in-charge of the home. “It is not their fault that they are HIV positive. Almost all of them got it from their parents.”But forget society, even family can be unforgiving. There is one 14-year-old girl from a well-to-do family, who lost both her parents to HIV/AIDS. When other family members realized she too was positive, they admitted her to ASRO. Once they took her home on a festival day but would not allow their daughter to play with her. When they returned the child to ASRO later in the evening, the child was in tears. And resolutely silent. With Sr Coshav’s gentle probing, the child opened up. The nun later counselled the family which relented and now take the child home for three or four days sometimes. “There is lot of misinformation among people. But they realize there is no danger when we tell them that we live with these children 24-hours in a day. We want to integrate them in society but the children live with rejection. Some express their hurt,” says Sr Felcy Lewis, who is also the resident nurse at the home.The oldest boy is 22-years old. He was admitted when he was around nine. He could not cope with studies and now works at the home. Except for the occasional cold, cough and fever, he keeps fairly good health. The youngest child is four years old who was admitted in June this year. She too is quite healthy. All children are taken for health check-ups to the GMC every month. But every six months, the children undergo blood tests at the GMC. In the last four years, only one child died at the home.Though the project is run by Caritas Goa, people donate generously in kind by giving rice, dal, coconut, sugar, milk, biscuits and bakery products. Occasionally, the home also gets chicken and fish.Waking up in the middle of the night to tend to a sick child is routine for the three nuns. But the boys and girls living under the same roof though in different quarters, are growing up. Naturally, there is the occasional display of affection.

In a status report on children impacted by HIV/AIDS, Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights has questioned the complex eligibility criteria for the scheme launched in fiscal 2012-13.A 2012 study by Delhi State AIDS Control Society estimates the number of orphans and vulnerable children in Delhi as 1,908, of whom 766 were infected with HIV/AIDS. Additionally, there were 1,142 children whose parents were infected with the virus. The data used in the DCPCR study was gathered during the period April 2010-March 2012 from nine antiretroviral treatment centres, Children Affected by AIDS (CABA) pilot scheme and two institutions providing residential care to CABA in Delhi.The DCPCR study finds the coverage of the Financial Assistance Scheme for People Living with HIV/AIDS ((PLHA) of Delhi Government wanting in many ways. The scheme has so far enrolled 1,726 infected adults and children,14 orphan children who lost their parents to HIV/AIDS, 26 orphaned HIV-positive children and 12 HIV-positive destitute children.A sum of Rs 1,000 is given as monthly benefit to PLHAs including infected children, Rs 1,750 to orphaned children who are not positive but affected by HIV/AIDS as their parents were infected with the virus and Rs 2,050 to orphans and destitute children infected by HIV/AIDS under the scheme.However, the DCPCR study says there is need to reach out to more children. It is stated that the eligibility criteria are too complex for an affected person to fulfill. According to these, a PLHA has to be on one year of Anti Retroviral Treatment and has to provide proof of the same. Besides being a resident of Delhi for three years, the beneficiary must have an annual family income of less than Rs 1 lakh. In case of orphaned children there has to be proof of death of one or both parents due to HIV/AIDS. In case of a destitute child, proof of HIV positive status is mandatory. The child must also be found living in an institution in Delhi. DCPCR strongly feels these need to be reviewed.“Often lack of papers like death certificate or proof of residence can hinder access to these schemes. If the process is simplified, more would be able to get its benefit,” DCPCR chairperson Arun Mathur said.","['relief', 'kids', 'infected', 'scheme', 'hiv', 'dcpcr', 'hivaids', 'study', 'parents', 'proof', 'rs', 'children', 'destitute', '52', 'delhi', 'orphans']","NEW DELHI: Just 52 orphans and destitute children have got the benefit of the only financial assistance scheme Delhi government offers to people living with HIV/AIDS.

The findings reinforce the need for national health authorities to ensure timely diagnosis of DR-TB, especially for vulnerable populations and including people living with HIV, in order to curb primary transmission.What is alarming is, that it provides evidence that primary transmission is the cause of DR-TB in as many as one in four newly-diagnosed TB patients.Primary DR-TB results from the direct transmission of DR-TB from one person to another. The prevention of primary transmission of DR-TB has largely been neglected during the development of TB control programmes.These patients were exposed to DR-TB mycobacterium either in their communities or during their visits to health facilities as they have no previous records of receiving treatment for TB.“In ‘hot-spots’ such as the slums of Mumbai, and among vulnerable groups such as people living with HIV, the DR-TB epidemic may be driven by primary transmission, rather than simply by a lack of adherence to TB treatment,” says Dr Petros Isaakidis, MSF principal investigator of the study. “The government needs to pay more attention to primary transmission of DR-TB, particularly in settings of high HIV prevalence and rapid TB spread. Promptly diagnosing and treating DR-TB is the solution to curb primary transmission.”The data highlights the urgent need to address DR-TB among people living with HIV by systematically offering screening, drug susceptibility testing (DST) and access to treatment based on actual resistance patterns.“We need to urgently prevent transmission of DR-TB to others. With DR-TB, treatment is prevention, and these findings should lead to a stronger focus on diagnostics and treatment of DR-TB, particularly in high HIV-prevalent settings,” says Eldred Tellis of the Mumbai AIDS Forum. “This is in addition to the fact that health authorities cannot afford to neglect TB infection control in overcrowded healthcare facilities like ART centres.”“This study comes at the right time. Studies like this are complementary to the national survey and are essential to get a close-up picture of the DR-TB epidemic in ‘hot-spots’ and marginalised populations,” says Dr Arun Bamne, co-author of the study and former executive health officer of Mumbai’s Public Health Department. “Such studies will help shape the national response with specific interventions for those populations most at risk of getting DR-TB.”TB is one of the most common opportunistic infections and a leading cause of death among people living with HIV/AIDS. Undiagnosed and untreated drug-resistant tuberculosis is a major cause of mortality and morbidity among people living with HIV.In September, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan formally launched the first-ever nationwide TB drug-resistance survey to get a better understanding of the disease in the country.","['hiv', 'alarming', 'transmission', 'health', 'primary', 'study', 'treatment', 'national', 'drtb', 'burden', 'level', 'tb', 'highlights', 'living']","The findings reinforce the need for national health authorities to ensure timely diagnosis of DR-TB, especially for vulnerable populations and including people living with HIV, in order to curb primary transmission.What is alarming is, that it provides evidence that primary transmission is the cause of DR-TB in as many as one in four newly-diagnosed TB patients.Primary DR-TB results from the direct transmission of DR-TB from one person to another.

Nevertheless, they expressed concerns surrounding their mental health. Some complained of high levels of depression which they said followed after they had disclosed their sexual orientation. Changed behaviour of their family members, ridicule from peers and a sense of social rejection, said the interviewees, have taken a toll on their self-esteem.The interviewees also pointed out lack of privacy in state-run STI clinics (health centres which deal with sexually transmitted diseases). Once their sexual identity is disclosed, the homosexuals often face discrimination and harassment. This, some stated, forced them into alcohol or substance abuse. As a remedy, most stated that they preferred individual counseling.“When the society ridicules, having multiple partners becomes a desirable way to feel accepted.

Immediate actions were taken to protect current patients once these apparent lapses were identified. However, this alleged drop in clinical standards may have put people at a low risk of blood born viruses like Hepatitis B, C and HIV. Therefore, as a precautionary measure, we are advising all patients who have seen Mr D’Mello to seek further advice on what action they may need to take”.The investigation team has also consulted with clinical experts in Public Health England, who undertook a clinical analysis of the potential risk to patients. Mr D’Mello has recently been tested by our Occupational Health Team and found to be clear of blood borne viruses.NHS said, “Based on this clinical advice, Public Health England has recommended screening for all patients who have been treated by Mr D’Mello. It is understood the number of patients affected who have been seen and treated by Mr D’Mello during his time at the former Daybrook Dental Practice is about 22,000, as he had worked at the practice for over 32 years”.","['england', 'hiv', 'history', 'health', 'patients', 'biggest', 'clinical', 'face', 'mr', 'medical', 'dental', 'treated', 'uk', 'dmello', 'practice', 'daybrook', 'recall', 'tests']","Immediate actions were taken to protect current patients once these apparent lapses were identified.

HOWRAH: Anwoman, who suffered injuries in a road accident, was allegedly turned down by two government hospitals in Howrah and Kolkata. Howrah District Hospital admitted her after a person intervened, but there she was allegedly kept overnight near the toilet of a ward, next to where a body was kept.When informed by TOI, the Howrah chief medical officer (health) expressed shock over the incident and said that he would get her admitted on Wednesday.On November 8, Babita Dolui (name changed), a resident of Ramrajatala, was travelling on a bicycle with her husband on Kona Expressway. The 32-year-old woman and her husband are masons and both of them were returning home from work .A speeding lorry knocked them down in Chatterjee Haat police station area. Babita fractured her right arm and cracked her spine, while her husband escaped with minor injuries. The police rushed her to Howrah District Hospital.“She was semi-conscious when she was taken to the hospital. Doctors and nurses at the hospital asked Babita’s husband whether she had any chronic disease. Her husband reportedly told them that she was HIV+. The doctors and nurses told my son-in-law that he also suffers from the “dirty” disease and they ought to lock him up. After hearing this, my son-in-law ran away. We came to know of the accident late in the evening. When we went to the hospital, Babita was lying on the floor and hadn’t been attended to. The doctors and nurses told us to take her away as they wouldn’t even touch her,” said Babita’s mother.The next day, Babita’s mother took her daughter to the Medical College and Hospital in Calcutta. The doctors there looked at the documents issued by the Howrah Hospital and told the elderly woman to take Babita away. “They told me that such patients can’t be treated there. They asked me to take her back home and wait for the injuries to heal naturally,” Babita’s mother added. When the woman produced a reference letter from local MLA Jatu Lahiri, a doctor allegedly retorted: “Who is the MLA to refer such a patient to us?”On Novermber 18, Babita’s mother informed the matter to their family friend Amit Goswami , who is a law clerk.Goswami then took her to Howrah District Hospital and insisted that they admit her. The hospital authorities assured Goswami that things would be taken care of.“Next morning, Babita was found lying on the floor next to the toilet of a ward. She said that a body had been kept on the floor beside her,” Babita’s mother said.","['away', 'hospital', 'told', 'hiv', 'doctors', 'babita', 'howrah', 'woman', 'positive', 'mother', 'shoo', 'hospitals', 'accident', 'nurses', 'babitas', 'husband', 'victim']","HIV positiveHOWRAH: Anwoman, who suffered injuries in a road accident, was allegedly turned down by two government hospitals in Howrah and Kolkata.

The dip among high-risk population however continues to be very marginal.For instance, the incidence fell from 0.61% in 2013 to mere 0.59% in 2014. Mumbai continues to be one of the high-risk districts within the state given the migration patterns. Over 2.30 lakh population, including 28,000 female sex workers, 19,000 men having sex with men and 1800 intravenous drug users, fall within this category.Dr Shrikala Acharya, additional project of Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) said that several steps are being taken to reach out to this population. “We are planning to open three new Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) at the Mumbai Port Trust. There will also be three mobile vans to facilitate testing among truckers,” she said. It is estimated that over 20,000 truckers halt in the city at any given year.MDACS, which is the nodal body to tackle HIV in the city, was itself reeling under a fund crunch till two weeks ago. They also had to take a loan of Rs8crore from the BMC to tide over the crunch. “It has not slowed down our activities. We are aiming at zero infection and discrimination,” she said. She added the body is adding two more antiretroviral centres to the existing dozen centres at Bhabha Hospital in Bandra and Rajawadi Hospital in Ghatkopar.Acharya added that the rates of mother-to-child transmission have also been steadily declining. From 1.10% in 2008-09 it has dropped to 0.25% in 2012-13. “The new multidrug regimen for prevention of HIV among newborns is working well,” she said.Around two years after the HIV epidemic hit home, the Maharashtra Aids Control Society (MSACS) has initiated a programme to trace patients who have been enrolled for care at some point. “Currently, at least 50,000 patients are lost to follow up, who may have died or migrated to other places. We will find them and give a unique number,” said Khushalsinh Pardeshi, project director, MSACS.","['city', 'mumbai', 'population', 'society', 'hiv', 'sex', 'prevalence', 'project', 'positive', 'testing', 'centres', 'truckers', 'dips']","MUMBAI: Amidst fears of rising infection and drying up of fund pool, the city has shown a healthy decline in HIV prevalence.

A quick shave could be a close shave. Hundreds of roadside barbers in the city use just one razor or blade for shaving several customers. This means that with just a nick by an infected razor/blade, a customer can contract fatal infections like AIDS and Hepatitis B and C.Shockingly, there is no system or organization in the state or even across the country to check this unsafe practice. There are no checks on the barbers working at various public places, especially at railway stations, bus stands and government hospitals. Hundreds of customers unknowingly expose themselves to danger when they go to such barbers.Straight razors with open steel blades , also commonly known as cut-throats, were the mostThese roadside barbers can be seen at every nook and corner of the town using either straight razors with open steel blades, commonly known as cut-throats or disposable razors. They perform multiple shaves within a few minutes and do not bother to change the blade. What is more shocking is that even the persons who get themselves shaved do not ask for a new blade or a fresh razor.“I shave at least 20 people every day. My customers are generally passengers who do not halt in the city but have come for a meeting or an exam. They freshen-up at public toilets at the station, get a shave here and go off to work,” said Sanju, a barber at Agra Fort Railway Station.This barber was ferrying his equipment in a box and had placed his makeshift salon on his bicycle. Needless to say, there is no scope, even for sterilizing the equipment or razors.The barber when asked about his knowledge on HIV and AIDS, he said, “Ye sab to galat kaam karne se hota hai, dadhi banwane se nahi. Or Itna sochenge to khayenge kya (These things happen because of wrong acts and not because of shaving. If we will think that much, what will we eat).”He further asserted that he charges only Rs 3 from a shave. If he increases the rates, people will not come to him.Similarly, a barber working outside SN Medical College was seen using the same old blade to shave patients’ relatives. What are the precautions he takes? His refrain is, “I clean the razor with warm water before using it on other customer. We also sharpen the razor on stones whereby it gets cleaned automatically,” said Daddu, standing by his small salon on pavement.He also cited his meager income for not changing blades for each customer.According to doctors, this unsafe practice by barbers is simply not on the same page as the HIV and AIDS control department. No educational sessions or workshops have ever been conducted for the barbers, who are barely aware of the damger of using the same blade on multiple customers.“Prevention is the only viable way to control HIV spread, as there is no cure for the infection presently. The risk of infection spreading is low with razors, maybe two in 1,000 but nevertheless, it is advisable that only one with disposable blades should be used,” said Dr CP Singh, expert from the medicine department of SN Medical College.He added that the general perception is that HIV is transmitted through unsafe sex, infected blood transfusions and mother-to-child. These are the second and third highest reasons for HIV infections. But HIV infections can also be passed through sharing of non-sterile sharp instruments such as those used by barbers, incision, tattooing, ear perforation, blood-letting, injections and acupuncture. These too have always been classified as “other” reasons for spreading the infection and therefore given less attention in the campaign against the spread of HIV.“Though barbers do not carry out procedures that deliberately penetrate the skin but sometimes just a single mick or cut caused by the clipper or razor blade is enough for an infection to occur,” added Dr Singh.The doctors when asked how safe is to clean or wash the blade before using, he informed that due to the lipid envelope that protects HIV from dehydration, the virus can survive on the surfaces of barbering instruments for a period long enough for transmission to occur, particularly in commercial barber shops.Talking to TOI, chief medical officer HS Danu said there are no measures or laws to stop this roadside barbering practice all across UP. This is an ethical responsibility of the district administration and civic body to issue no licenses to these roadside barbers.“But these days, they do not even halt at roadside. They ferry their salon on bycycles and its impossible to check such practices,” added the CMO.","['razor', 'barber', 'shave', 'hiv', 'razors', 'infection', 'blade', 'roadside', 'barbers', 'using', 'customers', 'expose']","AGRA: Even after spending crores in creating HIV and AIDS awareness, the precautions that must be taken against the deadly infection hinge on a razor’s edge.
Hundreds of roadside barbers in the city use just one razor or blade for shaving several customers.
There are no checks on the barbers working at various public places, especially at railway stations, bus stands and government hospitals.
My customers are generally passengers who do not halt in the city but have come for a meeting or an exam.
But HIV infections can also be passed through sharing of non-sterile sharp instruments such as those used by barbers, incision, tattooing, ear perforation, blood-letting, injections and acupuncture.",0

People with AIDS must be outspoken and see to it they get every facility to lead whatever life is left in them,” Gyan told TOI on the eve of World AIDS Day. His office is located at Mahendru.Gyan was leading a happy married life and engaged in gemstones’ business till September 2000, when he met an accident. “I was hospitalized at a government hospital for 15 days. But, I started falling ill frequently after that,” says Gyan. Probably, he contracted AIDS there, but he was unaware of it.In the meantime, he donated blood for a friend. After 15 days, he got a letter saying he should contact an ART centre. “I did not know what it was. When I went there, the banners talking about AIDS made me realize the impending disaster in my life,” Gyan says.Both he and his wife tested positive for AIDS. “We went into hiding for 15 days,” he says. They were advised not to bear kids. “We had earlier planned to have a test-tube baby, but shelved the plan,” Gyan says. On his father’s intervention, their medication started. Gyan wind up his business. In 2006, came the first high point. “My child was born and today he is six years old and leading a healthy life,” says Gyan.Gyan is today president of BNP. He gets support of Bihar State Aids Control Society, Plan India and other NGOs and “gets paid on project basis.” Today his organization has 58 staff, 80% of whom are HIV positive. Every staff member is a story unto him/herself.Gyan’s organization has chapters in five districts and facilitates surgeries of people with AIDS. When doctors refuse to operate on them, BNP takes up the issue with the management of the hospital concerned. “On November 29, a 30-year-old Danapur resident got operated for hernia at PMCH on our intervention. He was refused surgery two months back. This is what keeps me going,” says Gyan, his face beaming. His office has become one-stop point for such people. Over 1,000 persons awaiting surgeries are registered with his organization, which also provides counselling to people with AIDS and even marries them off. Recently, Gyan organized wedding of three HIV positivecouples.Asked about the lowest point in his struggle, he narrates a 2012 incident when he was sitting on dharna to protest shortage of antiretroviral drugs at BSACS office. “I was arrested and murder charge was slapped on me,” says Gyan, who was jailed for a month and released on bail thereafter.","['aids', 'yes', 'life', 'point', 'hiv', 'office', 'days', 'positive', 'crusader', 'gyan', 'today', 'organization']","Patna: It is a stigma for HIV positive people to disclose their identity but he turned the stigma into strength.

It also promises relief to patients from severe side effects caused by drugs prescribed under ART.HIV-AIDS patients would be put on fixed dose therapy (FDT) in which a single pill would be given in place of three drugs that cause side effects and will reduce pressure on kidney and liver.Speaking with TOI ahead of the world HIV AIDS Awareness Day, Indian Society of Haemetology and Blood Transfusion president A K Tripathi said, “FDT will soon be introduced across all ART centers across UP. In King George's Medical University it will be launched in mid-December.”The single pill, often referred to as the wonder drug in AIDS treatment, comprises three medicines given as first line of treatment. Also, salts used in them are better than the previous formula. One of these three (stavudine) was known to cause lipid abnormalities and neuropathy. As a result, fat deposits occur in the patient’s body in specific places while it dries up in other (lipodystrophy) leading to severe disfigurement. Blood cholestrol levels also go up posing risk to heart health and causing burning sensation in hands and feet. Stavudine has been replaced with tenofovir.The other salt called nevirapine had three major side effects, including damage to liver, severe allergic reaction and interference in treatment of tuberculosis. This salt has been replaced with effavirenz. The third medicine called lamivudine has been retained as it is.A policy decision to this effect was taken in May 2013 and was implemented later. It is now being launched in UP. “Side effects tend to compel patients to skip medicines, which compromises the adherence rate. Success of the aids control programme cannot be guaranteed unless adherence rate is above 90% which the wonder drug helps achieve,” explained Dr Tripathi.Besides introducing this drug, National Aids Control Organisation has introduced changes in the treatment guidelines which promise better success of the programme. One of them, which relates to pregnant women, says they should all be tested for HIV AIDS and if found positive, should be put on ART irrespective or the CD4 count reading.It may be noted that CD4 count is the parameter for putting a patient on ART. Till 2013 a CD4 count of 250 made an HIV-positive person eligible for ART. After a revised order, a CD4 count of 350 meant clearance for ART. The new guidelines also overlook CD4 count for HIV positive persons diagnosed of TB.","['aids', 'hiv', 'cd4', 'pills', 'drug', 'patients', 'treatment', 'count', 'cut', 'art', 'severe', 'therapy', 'effects', 'dose', 'launched']","Lucknow: A new protocol for management of HIV AIDS will be launched across AAL anti-retro-viral therapy (ART) centers across UP reducing the number of pills from three to one.

However, inconsistency in supplies and frequent stock outs of lifesaving HIV medicines in government owned centres in major cities like Delhi, Mumbai and the northeast have the potential to put India back in the danger zone, experts warn.“Once a patient starts the therapy, medicine needs to be taken daily with proper adherence, or else the drugs quickly lose their effectiveness. Once this happens, HIV patients have to switch to a second line of treatment which is five times more expensive than first-line drugs, adding an additional burden on our healthcare system,” said Daisy David, advocacy officer, World Vision India.Moreover, there is also a severe dearth of testing kits like CD4 and viral load, which are crucial for patients to monitor the virus and ascertain the stage of infection. “These tests are important because they help a doctor ascertain when to change the line of treatment for particular patients. In the absence of these tests, a patient may develop resistance to a certain medicine or line of treatment and hence develop the virus again,” said Vikas Ahuja, president of Delhi Network of Positive People, a trust that works with HIV/AIDS patients. WHO ) report last year said the Indian government was providing free anti-retroviral drugs for treating HIV since 2004, but only 50% of those eligible were getting it in 2012.According to Anand Grover, founder-president of Lawyers Collective, a faulty procurement policy, withdrawal of global funding from India and other middle income countries and discrimination with the vulnerable population including sex workers and drug addicts were major causes leading to such problems.The health ministry recently told Lok Sabha that though there were shortages, it had resolved the issue for the time being by procurement and donations from a domestic pharmaceutical company. The ministry has also initiated a computerized supply chain management system for assessment of drug requirement and their stocks.The latest data from National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) shows there are over 2.09 million HIV patients in India, with the north, south and northeast regions accounting for the majority of patients. The government receives nearly $80 million from the Global Fund, an international aid organisation for HIV prevention and treatment.The United Nations estimates India currently has the third largest population of people living with HIV in the world. However, NACO data shows a significant decline in prevalence of HIV among adults across the country. At national level, prevalence was estimated at 0.41% in 2001, whereas it dropped to 0.35% in 2006 and 0.27% in 2011, latest data with the department showed.Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director, WHO South-East Asia, said stigma, discrimination and restrictive laws continued to be barriers to accessing prevention, care and treatment services. “The HIV epidemic in our region is concentrated among populations most vulnerable to HIV: men who have sex with men, transgender people, people who inject drugs, sex workers, people in prisons and other closed settings. Although we have been successful in scaling up the health sector response for the vulnerable populations, more needs to be done. Less than 50% of these people know their HIV status,” she said.Though the government is hopeful the HIV and AIDS bill, drafted in 2006, which was tabled in the Rajya Sabha in February and is currently being considered by a parliamentary standing committee, will address most of these issues, Grover said even the draft bill keeps people with HIV and AIDS out of the purview of free medicines.“Just by ignoring the issue, the government cannot tackle the real menace of the disease. It needs to guarantee access to medicines for all,” Grover said.","['aids', 'hiv', 'sex', 'patients', 'test', 'world', 'workers', 'treatment', 'hits', 'medicines', 'scarcity', 'india', 'therapy', 'vulnerable', 'kit', 'drugs']","“These tests are important because they help a doctor ascertain when to change the line of treatment for particular patients.

A cause for alarm is that though the number of HIV infections has decreased this year as compared to the last, the number of HIV patients has increased.From January to October this year, Goa registered 128 cases of non-Goans among the total 376 cases registered across the state. During the corresponding period of last year, the figure was 86 of the total 386 cases registered by October 2013.Though the disease surfaced in Goa in 1987 when a foreigner was detected HIV positive with the second case being of a non-Goan in 1988, Goa has so-far registered 15,603 HIV positive persons. While Goa has registered 1,662 full-blown AIDS cases up to October, a total of 1,041 patients have lost their lives to AIDS by September this year, states data prepared by the Goa State AIDS Control Society (GSACS).According to data gathered by GSACS, HIV infection is now prevalent in all parts of Goa. What is worrying is that in Goa, HIV is not confined to coastal belts, but has penetrated to other areas, too. The disease is no longer an urban phenomenon, but has spread to rural areas as well. The HIV prevalence is shifting its base from one taluka to other, every year.In 2013, the majority of the cases was reported in the four coastal talukas: Salcete (18.4%), Mormugao (12.8%) in south Goa district and Tiswadi (11.5%) and Bardez (14.9%) in north Goa district during 2013.But, by October 2014, Tiswadi in the north showed a marginal decrease with 5.3% prevalence, while Bardez in the same district has shown a rise of about 2.7% (16.2% in 2014). In South Goa, Salcete has shown a decline of 4.3%. The taluka has noted 14.1% prevalence as against 18.4% of last year and Mormugao a decline of 2.7%. Last year, HIV prevalence in this taluka was 12.8% which has decreased to 10.1% this year, GSACS statistic stated. Dr Vandana Patankar, project director, GSACS, claimed that a large floating population in Goa has contributed to the bulging figure of HIV-infected in the state.People migrating to Goa from other Indian states raises the figure. The state has noted a spread of the disease largely by the sexual mode. While the state has a thriving drug trade on its coastal belts, there were very less number of people found affected with passing on the needles used for injecting narcotic drugs, she admitted.“Besides, most of the people from other Indian states come to Goa to get their blood sample checked as Goa has better facilities than other states,” Patankar said.She also said that Goa has proper counseling, awareness-raising measures, accurate testing facilities across the state and anti-retroviral treatment (ART) center at Goa medical college and hospital, Bambolim.

However, a study conducted by Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), an international NGO, says many a kala-azar patient are HIV positive, but are ignorant about it. Non-treatment of HIV weakens their immunity system, due to which even VL drugs do not show proper effect and are leading to relapse of VL. Incidentally, Bihar accounts for over 90% kala-azar (VL) cases in the world.The study published in an issue of an international journal, Clinical Infectious Diseases, says out of over 2,000 kala-azar patients screened in Hajipur, 117 were HIV positive. Only 68 of them had prior knowledge of it. The prevalence of VL-HIV was much higher in males (71.4%) than females (28.6%).It may be mentioned here that another study published in August 2014 in Public Library of Science ( PLOS ) had said that estimated chances of VL relapse in HIV positive people was over 25% after three years of treatment of kala-azar. The mortality rate of VL-HIV cases are also high. Even after four years of treatment of VL, 30% HIV-VL patients could not survive. There are also a couple of studies to suggest that early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV positive had bettered the results of VL treatment too.These figures should be alarming because, according to an estimate, over 3 lakh people have HIV/AIDS in Bihar. The PLOS study says that the risk of developing VL in HIV positive people is 100-2300 times higher compared to non-HIV people. It added, “Screening for VL in HIV cases living in VL-endemic areas must also be encouraged.”Experts say HIV test must become a part of protocol to treat VL. National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) had been assigned the task of developing guidelines to this effect in the road map released to eliminate VL by the then Union health minister, Dr Harsh Vardhan. While the state government still awaits any such guidelines, state programme officer M P Sharma said, “As of now, there is no plan to include HIV testing in the VL treatment protocol. At present, we are concentrating on the guidelines given by the Centre.”There is another issue of dosage of drugs. Recently, AmBisome (single dose treatment for VL) was launched in the state. However, experts say single dosage does not work well in HIV-VL patients. Dr Gaurab Mitra, who was one of the researchers of the study and works with MSF, told TOI, “Instead of giving it in one dose, we divide it into six doses. We believe and recommend the same in government protocol too.”His argument also finds support in the study mentioned in PLOS.

In accordance with the goals of United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS or UNAIDS , India is also aiming for ‘Zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination, zero AIDS-related deaths’. Dr Khaparde is optimistic about these goals being achieved in the years to come.“Initially, parent to child transmission (PPTC) was the cause of 27% of new HIV cases, which was brought down to 7% through various targeted interventions. At present, this rate is 1%. Every year, there is a cohort population of 29 million women we wish would undergo testing for HIV and syphilis. Unfortunately, due to healthcare not being accessible to all, not even half of this population is covered,” he said.The problems in the way of universal HIV testing of pregnant women include the infrastructure and staff being unavailable at levels below the district. “We are trying to tackle this problem by training nurses, non-medical staff and, if possible, even accredited social health activists (ASHA), in villages to test and counsel all pregnant women. Efforts are also being made to scale up programmes and infrastructure at community health centres and primary health centres with the aim of reaching all possible pregnant mothers in time,” said Dr Khaparde.As most other health issues, better treatment of HIV also requires contribution of the society. “We see that even today, there is many stigmas attached to the infection, from the general community and sometimes even healthcare professionals, that several patients hesitate to ask for help. On the level of governance, we have done much awareness generation,” he said.

The state government along with NGOs has reached villages for HIV screening,” said A Bakthavatchalam, deputy director, Association for Rural Mass India, an NGO.The state government and NGOs introduced a number of schemes to reach more people. “One scheme was to adopt 100 villages and engage into one-to-one conversations with people. Based on the conversations, we would test them for HIV,” said S Kalaiarasi, executive director, Swestic, an NGO that identifies and monitors people with HIV in five districts in Tamil Nadu.Kalairasi said awareness about methods of prevention has increased among risk-prone communities like the transgenders, homosexuals and sex workers. “Five years ago, a sex worker, especially in rural areas, would agree to sex without protection. Today, most sex workers insist on condoms and sometimes even explain the reason to the customer,” she said.Compulsory screening in certain areas has also helped reduce the number of cases. “An NGO would map a district based on the cases and list high-risk villages. In some cases, based on analysis, NGOs would insist on compulsory screening,” said Bakthvatchalam. “This was to help people get medical attention if they were in the initial stages.”Experts and NGOs attribute the higher screening rate to funding from and programmes by corporate and private bodies. “Over the years, besides the central and state government efforts, we have seen corporates and private bodies organizing screening camps and awareness, especially in the southern states,” said Raman.While Tamil Nadu is seeing sharp reduction in the number of fresh cases every year, the overall numbers are still high.

But it was only after enduring the trauma for a month.District medical and health officials said despite the government mandate of conducing three tests for confirming HIV positive cases, most private centres conduct a single test, which can be misleading as it is done without pre- and post-test counselling.“There have also been cases where people committed suicide or were taken ill after being declared HIV positive. Thanks to the single test carried out in most private centres for HIV testing, which often leads to wrong diagnosis,” stated Dr Ronanki Ramesh, additional district medical and health officer ( AIDS and leprosy).“To confirm whether a person is HIV positive, a series of three blood tests need to be done in half-an-hour, including Coombs, SD bioline and Sigma tests. There are also other types of test kits such as Quickcheck, Elisa, Western Blot Tests as prescribed by the World Health Organisation (WHO). However, most private centres furnish reports after conducting a single test (Tri Dot test), which is not foolproof and people end up being declared HIV positive when they are not. Such wrong diagnosis can lead to disastrous consequences,” said Dr Kutikuppala Surya Rao, who specialises in HIV/AIDS.“Moreover,patients are also not given pre-test and post-test counselling, which is an integral part of HIV testing. Triple drug ART regime is also skipped in some private centres and a single drug regime is given. Also, the private centres charge Rs 500 for this single test, which is done free-of-cost at the ICTCs and charge Rs 6000 for the ART drugs per month, which again is supplied to patients free of cost by the government. Monthly, on an average, around 10,000 HIV testing is done in government centres in the district besides the tests undertaken by private centres, which goes unrecorded,” said Dr Ramesh.“Another challenge in the treatment of HIV/AIDS is that patients turn up at the last moment when they have no option but to be administered ART (anti-retroviral drugs). They visit quacks,” added Dr Ramesh.","['private', 'confirm', 'hiv', 'test', 'dr', 'positive', 'testing', 'man', 'centres', 'single', 'tests']","VISAKHAPATNAM: A healthy person opts to undergo HIV test and approaches a private clinic.

The Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RSACS) is taking measures to increase the number of tests for HIV among pregnant women.There are 20% home births where they don’t lend an ear to the need of getting tested for HIV. According to health department officials, the institutional deliveries have increased significantly up to 80% but still 20% remain home-based deliveries.An RSACS official said, “In institutional deliveries, the chances of HIV transmission from mother to child reduces to 2-3% if universal precaution of delivery and proper medicines to prevent the transmission of HIV are taken. Also, such mothers should not breastfeed their babies.”There are 18 lakh pregnancies reported every year in the state. In 2013-14, RSACS tested 4.68 lakh pregnant women for HIV with their consent. Among them, 412 were tested positive for HIV and there was a risk of transmission from mother to child. In 2012-13, the RSACS had tested 3.86 lakh pregnant women and found 383 of them living with HIV.Three years have passed but a 25-year-old Usha’s (name changed) tears still trickle down when she remembers the moment her newly born baby was declared tested positive for HIV.She was a resident of Jharkhand before she was married to a resident of the city. “I came to know that I am HIV positive at the time of my son’s birth. He was born in a government hospital in Jaipur three years ago. When doctors tested him for HIV, they informed me that he is born with HIV infection. Now, like me, he is also taking medicines for the infection,” said Usha on the eve of World AIDS Day. She added that she could not even breastfed her baby like other mothers as doctors had asked her not to do so.Usha’s case highlights vertical transmission of HIV from mother to baby at a time when there are medicines available which could reduce the risk of transmission of HIV from mother to baby during child birth.Besides, Sunita (name changed), a 35-year-old woman living with HIV also narrated the same story. She said that her first child, a girl is HIV positive and she came to know that her husband and she – both were HIV positive during their first child birth. “My five-year-old daughter is HIV positive like my husband and me. But, I am happy for my son as he does not have this disease. The doctors had him tested for HIV after his birth but he is HIV negative because I took some medicines to prevent the vertical transmission,” said Sunita, who is one of those HIV positive women, who had gathered at Statue Circle in Jaipur on the eve of World AIDS Day.","['rajasthan', 'tested', 'women', 'hiv', 'transmission', 'pregnant', 'positive', 'testing', 'child', 'mother', 'promotes', 'medicines', 'rsacs']","In 2013-14, RSACS tested 4.68 lakh pregnant women for HIV with their consent.

Anti-HIV crusaders fear that substandard quality of free condoms alone can push up HIV prevalence.Over the last few months, cash-strapped NGOs and community-based organisations (CBO) have raised the issue of inferior quality condoms with government agencies.A Malad-based CBO has often written to National Aids Control Organisation ( NACO ), that inferior quality of condoms has rendered its distribution among transgenders useless. “Our workers are ridiculed for distributing condoms, which lack proper lubrication,” said Gauri Sawant of the CBO.Quality assumes importance in Mumbai which has nearly 2.50lakh people in the high-risk zone and vulnerable to contract the infection. “Condom distribution is key to curbing infection among men having sex with men and female sex workers,” said Ashok Row Kavi founder of Humsafar Trust. “Super-lubricated condoms are not that useful. We must provide regular condoms with extra lubrication,” he said.While NGOs are supposed to get 80% of condom supply from NACO, they are expected to forge ties with manufacturers to arrange for the remaining 20%. NGOs say due to payment issues they hardly manage to get private firms interested in supplying them.For NGOs working with female sex workers, it becomes a dual challenge. “It takes a lot of persuasion for a sex worker to convince a client to use a condom. The least NACO can ensure is to provide good quality condoms,” said a CBO working with female sex workers.NACO refused knowledge of quality concerns. “There have been problems with supply, which will be streamlined soon.

He met with a severe accident in the same year. “I was hospitalised in a government hospital and discharged after 15 days But I started falling ill pretty often after that,” says Gyan. AIDS, says Gyan, was probably developed there but he was unaware. Skin started becoming dead and blisteres developed.In the meantime, he donated blood for his friend. After 15 days of donation, he got a letter saying he should contact ART centre. “I did not know about the ART centre.

Estimates by National Aids Control Organization ( NACO ), which works under the ministry of health and family welfare, show over 22 million people were tested during 2013-14, of which 2,40,234 people were found HIV positive. This included over 12,000 pregnant women who were diagnosed with the virus.“The low level of awareness among HIV positive population is of concern because research shows that early diagnosis is crucial. It allows patients to start on treatment sooner, which can greatly reduce the risk of spreading the infection to partners. Detecting the virus early also improves health outcomes for infected patients,” said Gerald Schochetman, senior director, Infectious Diseases and Diagnostic Research, Abbott.Government officials as well as health experts say the risk is more among the vulnerable population that practises high risk behaviour or have higher chances of HIV prevalence. This includes sex workers, trans-genders and even long-distance truckers.Over the years, counselling and testing centres across the country have increased with many private laboratories now offering HIV detection tests apart from the government centres. In 1997, there were just 67 HIV testing and counselling sites in India, whereas NACO data shows there over 15,000 healthcare facilities offering counselling and testing across the country in 2014.“Counselling and testing services are important components of prevention and control of AIDS in the country,” said Anand Grover, founder-president of Lawyers Collective. Grover said instead of cutting corners with the vulnerable population by criminalizing them, government should counsel and provide them with proper care so that they do not transmit the disease further.“In the past few years, the number of infections has declined in India because we worked with the vulnerable population, distributed condoms and made them aware. One needs to partner them so that they help in not increasing the burden,” Grover said.The UN estimates that India currently has the third largest population of HIV infected people in the world.

HIV is evolving to become less deadly and less infectious, according to a major scientific study led by British scientists.The team at the University of Oxford has shown that it was taking longer for HIV infection to cause AIDS The rapid evolution of HIV, which has allowed the virus to develop resistance to patients’ natural immunity is at the same time slowing the virus’s ability to cause AIDS.The study also indicates that people infected by HIV are likely to progress to AIDS more slowly — in other words the virus becomes less virulent — because of widespread access to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Both processes make an important contribution to the overall goal of the control and eradication of the HIV epidemic.Scientists said: “Twenty years ago the time to AIDS was 10 years, but in the last 10 years in Botswana that might have increased to 12.5 years. One might imagine as time extends this could stretch further and further and in the future people being asymptomatic for decades.”In 2013, there were a total of 35 million people living with HIV worldwide according to the World Health Organization.The study was led by researchers at the University of Oxford, along with scientists from South Africa, Canada, Tokyo, Harvard University and Microsoft Research Schoolgirls take part in an HIV/AIDS awareness rally on World AIDS Day at a School in Patiala, on December 1, 2014.Lead scientist Professor Phillip Goulder from the University of Oxford, said: “This research highlights the fact that HIV adaptation to the most effective immune responses we can make against it comes at a significant cost to its ability to replicate. Anything we can do to increase the pressure on HIV in this way may allow scientists to reduce the destructive power of HIV over time.”Bill Clinton, former US president, addresses the crowd at a musical concert organized to spread awareness about HIV/AIDS on World AIDS day in New York City, on December 1, 2014.The research was carried out in Botswana and South Africa, two countries that have been worst affected by the HIV epidemic. Across those countries, researchers enrolled over 2000 women with chronic HIV infection to take part in the study.The first part of the study looked at whether the interaction between the body’s natural immune response and HIV leads to the virus becoming less virulent.Central to this investigation are proteins in our blood called the human leukocyte antigens (HLA), which enable the immune system to differentiate between the human body's proteins and the proteins of pathogens. People with a gene that expresses a particular HLA protein called HLA-B57 , are known to benefit from a protective effect to HIV.Infected patients with the HLA-B57 gene progress more slowly than usual to AIDS.College and Schoolstudents hold a giant red ribbon made by themselves during an event to raise awareness of HIV/AIDS on the World AIDS Day, in Fuyang, China, on December 1, 2014.This study showed that in Botswana, where HIV has evolved to adapt to HLA-B57 more than in South Africa, patients no longer benefit from this gene’s protective effect.However, the team’s data show that the cost of this adaptation to HIV is that its ability to replicate is significantly reduced, therefore making the virus less virulent.The authors show that viral adaptation to protective gene variants, such as HLA-B57, is driving down the virulence of transmitted HIV and is thereby contributing to HIV elimination.In the second part of the study the authors examined the impact of ART on HIV virulence. They developed a mathematical model, which concluded that selective treatment of people with low CD4 counts will accelerate the evolution of HIV variants with a weaker ability to replicate.","['aids', 'research', 'edge', 'hiv', 'losing', 'virus', 'form', 'world', 'hlab57', 'university', 'ability', 'study', 'evolving', 'finds', 'milder', 'south']","LONDON: One of the world’s most feared virus is losing its edge.

They developed a mathematical model, which concluded that selective treatment of people with low CD4 counts will accelerate the evolution of HIV variants with a weaker ability to replicate.",0

But, what’s bothering doctors and counsellors working with people living with HIV/AIDS is the casual attitude of the infected persons.Despite counselling, many don’t take any precautions and pass on the infection to his/her partner. The ART (anti-retroviral therapy) center located in Goa medical college (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, receives many such cases.At the end of the day, the staff members find themselves exasperated when a new case of HIV is detected, and the source of infection is one of the patients taking treatment at the center. “And we wonder whether we are doing any good to the society. We help them get well, and they go out and spread infection,” said a ART staff member who recently dealt with a case of a 24-year-old man, who gave infection to his wife.When he walked in the center a year ago, he was thoroughly counselledalong with his mother and told not toget married.“Not only did he marry a HIV negative girl, but within a year had his 19-year-old wife infected, and now he wants to have a child too,” said a ART member.“I wanted somebody to take care of my son,” was themother‘s lame excuse when questioned about her son's marriage.The staff at the ART center has tried its best to dissuade him from having a child, but he is adamant. “We have even told him that the baby may be born HIV positive. But you know, what he said? ‘You people will cure him’. The staff member said she was infuriated when he heard him say that.A counsellor said, “It’s not that all don’t listen, but then there’s no way we can do anything other than telling them what they should and should not do.”“When we counsel them, they hear us with rapt attention. When we ask whether they will follow our instructions, they answer in the affirmative. But some chose to defy us,” she adds.She also said that some of the commercial sex workers who visit the ART center to collect their regular dose of medicines, have been spotted by them soliciting customers.Dr Vandana Patankar, project director, Goa state AIDS control society (GSACS), said this type of attitude is evident among HIV/AIDS patients as they want to prove to others that they are normal. “They want to also hide their infection also because of stigma attached to HIV/AIDs,” she said further adding they are doing all they can do to generate awareness about HIV/AIDS.","['irks', 'casual', 'counsellors', 'hiv', 'doctors', 'patients', 'center', 'told', 'society', 'hivaids', 'art', 'staff', 'infection', 'goa', 'attitude']","PANAJI: Over the years, the rate of HIV infection has declined in Goa and some four-five new cases of HIV/AIDS are detected every month.

Some regions in the country continue to record a large number of HIV cases, which is why the national average still shows a positive trend on a graph. Until the national average comes to stagnation, a reverse trend is almost impossible. The migration of citizens will continue to spread the infection,” said Marfatia.According to Dr Mohammed Hussain, who handles HIV patients at SSG Hospital, transmission of the virus still continues at considerable rate. “There still remains a section across the social strata of the population that do not go for regular check-ups. HIV virus can stay in the human body without causing any trouble for years, but the infection can be transmitted to another person,” he added.The study conducted by Marfatia suggests that nearly 68 per cent of spouses get infected because the disease was never detected in their partners. “Heterosexual intercourse is the commonest route of HIV transmission in India. The unaffected spouse could incur the infection for two basic reasons – either the infected person is unaware of the infection or the infected person deliberately hides the information,” added Marfatia.Sixty-six HIV positive patients and their partners from in and around the city were studied during the research project. The study concluded showed that unprotected sex between spouses remains a major cause of HIV transmission.“The transmission of HIV and AIDS due to blood transfusion or reused syringe has gone down to almost zero per cent. Multiple sex partners and unprotected sex remains the major cause now. People have to understand that regular check-ups and discussing about AIDS can solve the problem to a great extent,” Marfatia said.","['partners', 'way', 'shows', 'long', 'hiv', 'sex', 'virus', 'spread', 'transmission', 'person', 'stagnant', 'study', 'remains', 'infection', 'decline']","Some regions in the country continue to record a large number of HIV cases, which is why the national average still shows a positive trend on a graph.

Earlier, local people had allegedly drove her husband to commit suicide by taunting him repeatedly for his HIV Positive status and threatening eviction.A “nexus” between local landsharks, the councillor’s husband and the former land owner of the house allegedly conspired to evict the woman by instigating neighbours to banish the “morally corrupt” woman from the area.She and her children were dragged out of the house on November 23 and the door was padlocked.

I decided to keep my condition under wraps when doctors said we could lead a normal life under medication and care. I looked forward to life as my two sons were not infected.

The state has earned the dubious third position after Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat to report this alarming trend, raising a serious question over the quality of blood transfused to unsuspecting patients.The shocking disclosure comes at a time when the HIV-fighting agencies have had people believe that transfusion-transmitted infection has almost been eliminated. The RTI response showed that between April and October 2014, around 629 people across the country, including 80 in the state, got HIV through blood transfusion. The cumulative count for the past five years is 8,983 people who got HIV through blood transfusion in India.The data collected from Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) through voluntary disclosure of clients, though, has raised a storm among the HIV-fighting agencies at the state and the Centre. While officials have questioned its veracity, activists insist the numbers expose the glaring lack of accountability when it comes to ensuring quality of blood supplied by blood banks. Interestingly, nodal agencies such as the State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC) and the Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS) have put the onus on each other to ensure blood banks play by the rule and detect every HIV case.Experts say a fundamental problem is the fact that HIV in most blood banks is still tested through enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay test (ELISA) that has an innate shortcoming. “If a person has recently contracted HIV, this test may not show. It can detect HIV antibodies that take a minimum of three months to show in the blood. So if a person donates blood, it will end up getting transfused,” said an ICTC staffer from Parel’s KEM Hospital.“Due to financial constraints, most blood banks have not graduated to advanced tests such as nuclear acid testing (NAT) that cut down the HIV detection window period from few months to a week,” said Vinay Shetty of NGO Think Foundation. Currently, only a handful of the city’s leading private hospitals offer NAT-tested blood, which again comes at a premium fee of at least Rs 1,200 per unit. “None of the state-run and BMC blood banks, however, have this facility,” he said.In an RTI response, has revealed that nearly 1,000 people contracted the human immunodeficiency (HIV) virus in Maharashtra due to transfusion of infected blood over the past five years.In fact, there is also a worrying amount of negligence while conducting and then screening blood, said a senior technician from a leading blood bank. “Any person who tests positive for HIV during a donation camp is seldom informed about his status or referred to an ICTC centre, although both are mandatory. Therefore, that person goes about donating several times till he is detected at some point,” said the technician, adding that several youngsters, in fact, bank on blood camps to find out about their status. “Once they do not get follow-up calls, they go about things normally,” he added.Officials from the SBTC, though, feel the numbers are not that bad given that there are 11 lakh donations on an average annually. “How much can we trust voluntary disclosures by people who may be unwilling to disclose how they actually contracted the virus? Also, SBTC’s role is to ensure blood is available for everyone. The infection part is dealt with by MSACS,” said Dr Sanjay Jadhav, director, State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC).MSACS, on the other hand, said it is SBTC that monitors all activities of blood banks. “The information on number of people infected with HIV due to infected blood transfusion is not available with us. There is an option of recording the mode of transmission of HIV for clients being tested at ICTC. However, there are no means to verify this,” said Khushalsinh Pardeshi, project director, MSACS. The bickering between the agencies also highlights how none of them may be actively monitoring the number of HIV infections happening through the transfusion route.According to MSACS data, annual new HIV infections in Maharashtra have reduced from 10,431 in 2007 to 5,893 in 2011 while there has been a 49% decline in AIDS related deaths.","['infected', 'ictc', 'hiv', 'blood', 'person', 'msacs', 'maharashtra', 'cases', 'banks', 'transfusion', 'state', '1000']","MUMBAI: The National Aids Control Organisation , in an RTI response, has revealed that nearly 1,000 people contracted the human immunodeficiency ( HIV ) virus in Maharashtra due to transfusion of infected blood over the past five years.

Once inside a host, these strains can recombine into a new variant of the virus, researchers said.One such recombinant variant observed in patients in Cuba appears to be much more aggressive than other known forms of HIV, researchers said. Before it can enter human cells, HIV must first anchor itself to them. The virus does this via anchor points, or co-receptors, which are proteins on the cell membrane.In a normal infection, the virus first uses the anchor point CCR5. In many patients, after a number of healthy years, the virus then switches to the anchor point CXCR4. This co-receptor switch coincides with a faster progression to AIDS.Researchers at KU Leuven's Laboratory for Clinical and Epidemiological Virology in Belgium have described a recombinant form of HIV observed in patients in Cuba that makes this transition much faster. The virus targets the anchor point CXCR4 early after infection, shortening drastically the healthy phase and triggering rapid progression to AIDS.The transition from anchor point CCR5 to CXCR4 is normally very difficult. Researchers suspect that the rapid transition observed in this HIV recombinant occurs as a result of combining fragments from different HIV subtypes.","['aids', 'anchor', 'point', 'hiv', 'virus', 'form', 'patients', 'cxcr4', 'transition', 'observed', 'aggressive', 'accelerates', 'researchers', 'recombinant']","LONDON: A new aggressive form of HIV can progress to AIDS in just three years - so rapidly that patients may not even realize they were infected, scientists say.Engaging in unprotected sex with multiple partners increases the risk of contracting multiple strains of HIV.

As TOI checked with some counsellors, who carry out these free tests, there is acute shortage of these kits as well as of gloves, syringes and vacuum tubes. Those from the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community and sex workers are fearful that, since no tests are being conducted, there can be a rise in HIV/AIDS cases among them.Ravi, an NGO employee working with gay and bisexual men, says members of this community must go for the tests every six months. “The counsellor at Aruna Asaf Ali Hospital said there are no kits.

Herself an activist, Mallika is worried as “convincing transgenders to take the tests is very difficult. Now, with no kits, the disease will only spread. When we asked the counsellors, they said there is shortage at the government level”. Some members of the community are convinced that the government has intentionally pulled the plug from the programme. “My partner and I are experiencing symptoms of HIV. We are both very anxious and now kits aren’t available. I think the government is looking for ways to finish off the community,” Kunal, who went to Hindu Rao Hospital for the test but had to return without it done, said. A counsellor working at Aruna Asaf Ali hospital in Civil Lines confirmed the shortage. “Even if a kit is available, we ask them to get gloves, syringes and vacuum tubes as there is acute shortage,” she said. Since there are no funds, even reports are sometimes given verbally.The 92 NGOs associated with the government AIDS awareness programme haven’t been paid for the past seven months and many are now pulling out. Rupika, an NGO worker, is working without salary for eight months. “We want Delhi government to intervene immediately,” she said. The community is now planning to meet chief minister Arvind Kejriwal at one of his Janta Darbars. “If that doesn’t help, we will have to protest outside Delhi secretariat,” a transgender said.","['kits', 'months', 'sex', 'hiv', 'available', 'workers', 'test', 'working', 'transgender', 'hospital', 'shortage', 'lgbt', 'community', 'delhi', 'tests']","NEW DELHI: For the past one-and-a-half months, there are no HIV testing kits available in Delhi’s Integrated Counselling and Testing Centers.

Researchers found that the new drug candidate blocks every strain of HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus) that has been isolated from humans or rhesus macaques, including the hardest-to-stop variants. It also protects against much-higher doses of virus than occur in most human transmission and does so for at least eight months after injection.“Our compound is the broadest and most potent entry inhibitor described so far,” said Michael Farzan, from the Florida campus of The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI). When HIV infects a cell, it targets the CD4 lymphocyte, an integral part of the body’s immune system. HIV fuses with the cell and inserts its own genetic material and transforms the host cell into a HIV manufacturing site.The new study builds on previous discoveries by the Farzan laboratory, which show that a co-receptor called CCR5 contains unusual modifications in its critical HIV-binding region, and that proteins based on this region can be used to prevent infection.Farzan and his team developed the new drug candidate so that it binds to two sites on the surface of the virus simultaneously, preventing entry of HIV into the host cell.“When antibodies try to mimic the receptor, they touch a lot of other parts of the viral envelope that HIV can change with ease,” said TSRI Research Associate Matthew Gardner, the first author of the study with Lisa M Kattenhorn of Harvard Medical School.The team also leveraged preexisting technology in designing a delivery vehicle - an engineered adeno-associated virus, a small, relatively innocuous virus that causes no disease. Once injected into muscle tissue, like HIV itself, the vehicle turns those cells into “factories” that could produce enough of the new protective protein to last for years, perhaps decades, Farzan said.","['boost', 'raises', 'tsri', 'hiv', 'vaccine', 'virus', 'drug', 'team', 'candidate', 'vehicle', 'study', 'hope', 'cell', 'big', 'farzan']","WASHINGTON: Scientists have developed a novel drug candidate that may lead to a potent and universally effective HIV vaccine .

Now, under the Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP) it will soon use the latest equipment and testing tool called CBNAAT (cartridge based nucleic acid amplification test). This is meant for HIV positive patients, who are extremely prone to get TB as a secondary infection due to the drastic fall in their immunity.The centre has already procured the CBNAAT equipment (commonly called as gene Xpert) under the RNTCP. It will be installed in a specially created laboratory for it in the IGGMC premises on March 24. Dr Sadaf Khateeb medical officer of NMC’s TB centre, said that this test has emerged as a boon to HIV patients, who are usually also suffering from TB.""Under the RNTCP programme, and as per WHO guidelines, we have been told to put all co-infected or HIV positive and suspected TB patient to this test. This can diagnose the patient for TB in general as well as the multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB within two hours. Since the instrument generates an automated report, the test can be conducted even by a laboratory technician ,"" she said.Though the centre is meant for only patients living within NMC limits, all patients found to be HIV positive at the Anti-Retro-viral Therapy (ART) centre of IGGMC, the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) or other NMC hospitals can be referred for TB and MDR-TB diagnosis here. “General TB patients still have to be diagnosed using the culture test, which takes about 3-5 months. But HIV positive patients suspected to be suffering from TB cannot be made to wait so much. Hence, such patients from all over the city, region and neighbouring states who come to government hospitals here can be sent to the NMC centre,” said Dr Khateeb.He said that cases of non-pulmonary (or non-lung) TB patients are on the rise in general but their percentage is higher in HIV positive patients. They are commonly diagnosed with abdominal TB, cervical lymph nodes (on the neck) etc. The HIV positive patients who are suffering from TB generally test negative in conventional smear test. But with CBNAAT, it will now be possible to easily diagnose them for TB or MDR-TB as soon as their ART treatment is started once they are referred to the NMC centre.In 2014, the centre had registered over 200 TB patients. Of these, 95% were tested for MDR and some 25-30 patients were HIV positive too.

Coming to terms with the fact she and her six-year-old daughter are HIV positive, the 30-year-old daily wage worker is also faced with another challenge. Her daughter is underweight and Lakshmi is unable to provide her with nutritious meals because she has to spend most of her earnings on medicines. ""I can only afford rice, not green leafy vegetables, milk and eggs that the doctor advised for my daughter. Where will I find the money for it,"" she says.Lakshmi is not the exception. A study conducted by the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis (NIRT) in the city found that more than half the children (59%) living with HIV hail from families that do not have reliable access to sufficient quantity of affordable and nutritious food, leading to malnutrition. This is mainly because HIV hits the productive age groups the most, causing a dip in the family income and reduced food availability for the entire household. The study shows that the effect of food insecurity in these families has left 72% of children above five and living with HIV underweight , about 69% with stunted growth and 76% wasting (low weight for height). The proportion was high especially when compared to data from the National Family Health Survey which shows the national average for underweight children and those with stunted growth below the age of five varies between 40 and 50% and between 48 and 60% respectively.The 147 children aged between one and 15 years surveyed for the study conducted at the anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centre of a government tertiary-care hospital were either under the care of a single parent, mostly the mother as the father had died of HIV, or under foster care. Food insecurity in households is a problem across the country and one might ask why only children with HIV. Infections like HIV are catabolic diseases which results in diminished muscle mass and body fat. So, the daily dietary need of those with HIV is more,"" says C Padmapriyadarsini, scientist, NIRT.Since malnutrition in early childhood has a spiralling effect leading to decreased cognitive, psychosocial and physical development which would affect the academic performance of the child, NIRT has recommended measures to complement the ART course. While Anti-Retroviral Therapy has been effective in controlling the disease, the study suggests interventions like targeted food assistance to the families.Padmapriyadarsini says that a nutritional supplement would also go a long way in increasing adherence to drug management and improving nutritional status. The drugs would then act better on the individual without adverse effects and it would enhance a child's development.The children involved in the NIRT study have been regularly provided with such nutritional supplements and their parents trained to provide such a diet at home at low cost. The study was done in association with Institute of Child Health and Hospital For Children and Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society. NIRT now hopes that it can convince policymakers to adopt a similar strategy on a broader level. According to the National AIDS Control Organisation, there are 6,504 children living with HIV/AIDS in Tamil Nadu. Of these, 2,201 are boys and 1,849 are girls aged below 15, who are on ART as of September 2014.","['kids', 'hiv', '60', 'tn', 'face', 'underweight', 'study', 'nearly', 'insecurity', 'national', 'daughter', 'nutritional', 'children', 'nirt', 'food', 'living']","Coming to terms with the fact she and her six-year-old daughter are HIV positive, the 30-year-old daily wage worker is also faced with another challenge.

However, children with the disease often can’t avail of them, mostly because there is no one to look after them and take them to the hospital. An organization run by an American has come to the rescue of more than 3,000 children living with HIV (CLHIV) from the city. Jerry Hughes from Minnesota, USA, has been coming to the city for the last 10 years to spread awareness about HIV-AIDS and inspire PLHIVs to be optimistic. Through the Hughes Foundation, he has also made considerable contributions to the lives of positive people in Namibia and India. Having shifted base to the city in December, after leaving a well paying job and a promising career in advertising, Jerry now plans to focus all his energies on helping HIV positive children and women of the region.“For ten years, I have been visiting Nagpur off and on to interact with PLHIVs and activists here. I felt like the place and the people were beckoning me to help and contribute in any way I could. It led to what I call ‘India 10.0’, a project in which we aim to change the face of AIDS in India. We have started with 17 orphans who are HIV positive,” said Jerry, himself an HIV positive person.For two months now, an old, beat up car is being used to cater to the health needs of these and other kids with the infection. The organization also runs a pen pal programme for women suffering from the disease, where they write emails to students at Jerry’s alma mater, the University of Minnesota . His ultimate goal is to start a centre that provides free treatment, counselling and creates awareness about the disease.The kids under the project have been provided for by a corporate group from the city while activist Samir Shinde has been looking after them for the past four years. “These are children who require special care in terms of health, nutrition, medication and developmental issues. They are also prone to becoming sick more often. Therefore, we also arrange a lot of fun activities – picnics, games, movie nights – to help their cognitive development,” he said.These activities also help in lightening the burdened souls of the kids. “HIV and people suffering from it often paint a dull, drab picture. Personally, I would like to give it a facelift, bringing in an element of hope and fun,” said Jerry.This has already begun in the form of a 1930s Hollywood-style promotional video and ‘scooter cam’, a series of social experiment videos on topics like, ‘Does mosquito bites cause HIV?’ put up on the various social media platforms of the foundation.","['kids', 'city', 'help', 'women', 'hiv', 'suffering', 'helping', 'positive', 'jerry', 'children', 'americanturnednagpurian', 'india']","NAGPUR: There are several free services and treatments provided by the government for people living with HIV (PLHIV).

In 2013, 505 new cases were detected whereas in 2014 the number fell to 449.Vandana Pathankar, project director, GSACS, said that on April 1 they completed 10 years of introduction of ART therapy in Goa. While initially there was only one ART centre located in Goa Medical College (GMC) and Hospital, Bambolim, which catered to over 1,000 patients, where free anti-retroviral drugs were made available, subsequently link ART plus centers were opened in the South Goa district hospital, Margao, sub-district hospital, Ponda and Cottage hospital, Chicalim.A large number of HIV infections occurred through the perinatal route, and annual infections through this route were between 4 to 5%. The GSACS has adopted Prevention of Parent-to-child Transmission (PPTCT) strategy which is considered cost-effective method in controlling the virus via this route. This programme basically helps effective reduction of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection by providing quality antenatal care including preventive services.Since introduction of this programme, HIV prevalence rate among antenatal mothers who accepted HIV test has decreased from 1.48 %, in 2003 to 0.18 in 2013.GSACS’s annual bulletin has revealed that 89% of the spouses who opted for HIV test were tested positive, and HIV prevalence directly in labour has decreased from 2.46% in 2003 to 0% in 2013.Also, prominent change noted by GSACS is that the proportion of direct walk-in persons undergoing HIV testing has registered a steep increase — this is also true of female patients.Currently, GSACS also focuses on improving HIV/AIDs awareness, controlling sexually transmitted diseases (STD), including condom promotion, and ensuring availability of safe blood and blood products.Another focus area of GSACS is ART. The ART, though it does not cure HIV, it slows down the virus from multiplying so fewer viruses attack the immune system once an HIV positive person starts the treatment, says a doctor at GSACS.An HIV positive person on ART therapy can to a large extent lead a healthy life but subject to good adherence to the first line of ART.

However, there is one vaccine that has been found to cut TB disease incidence in India by half — food.Chronic lack of adequate food is the reason for more than half of the TB infections here progressing to become a fullblown disease, says a study.In an international publication 'Eradicating TB - Challenges, Perspectives, Solutions', of the Observer Research Foundation, experts from across the world and India stressed on the need for India's TB control programme to take into account the role of social conditions such as rising inequity, malnutrition , poverty and over-crowding in the spread of TB.Even though 40% of the Indian population or 480 million people carry the TB bug within their body, TB cases annually is estimated to be 2.3 million, a fraction of those who carry the infection. ""Over 90% of those carrying the TB bug are able to prevent the infection from becoming TB disease with the help of the body's immune system. Anything that reduces the strength of one's immunity, like lack of good nutritious food, increases the risk of contracting TB,"" explained Dr Anurag Bhargava of the Himalayan Institute of Medicine and an expert on TB treatment.Instead of Direct Observed Treatment Short course (DOTS), a World Health Organisation (WHO) concept, Dr Bhargava felt that it might be more effective to have a programme more suited to Indian needs called DOST—Directly Observed and Supported Treatment – which would offer TB patients and their families nutritional support and counselling through behavorial change of healthcare providers along with treatment.He added that several studies have shown that unlike many African countries, where HIV is the biggest risk factor for TB, in India, 55% of TB is attributable to under nutrition.An annual estimated mortality of 2, 70,000 deaths means that TB claims one life in India every two minutes. According to R S Gupta, former deputy director general of the Central TB Division in India, malnutrition is one of the primary reasons for the high incidence of TB. ""TB patients suffers from loss of appetite, nutrient malabsorption, micronutrient malabsorption and altered metabolism, which leads to wasting. Deficiency in proteins and micronutrients increases the risk of TB. It has been found that malnourished TB patients have delayed recovery and higher mortality rates than well-nourished patients,"" said Gupta.""It cannot be stressed enough that without ensuring better nutrition and environmental conditions, mere medication, no matter how good and effectively administered, is unlikely to solve the problem,"" said Harsh Sethi of the Observer Research Foundation. He added that, an underfed citizenry forced to live in unsanitary surroundings is unlikely to respond favourably to medical care.","['research', 'hiv', 'vaccine', 'patients', 'disease', 'world', 'malnutrition', 'risk', 'treatment', 'cases', '55', 'unlikely', 'india', 'tb']","""Over 90% of those carrying the TB bug are able to prevent the infection from becoming TB disease with the help of the body's immune system.

It showed not just significant improvement in nutritional parameters, but also that the CD4 cell count of these patients remained stable, indicating their immunity was being maintained. The patients who took part in the study were were not on antiretroviral therapy (ART).CD4 cells are a type of white blood cells that protect the body from infection. Once infected with HIV, the cells are attacked and destroyed by the virus. However, at the time of the study, the guideline recommended initiation of ART before CD4 cell counts decrease below 250 cells while the recent guidelines suggest 350 cells.Malnutrition in HIV-positive adults is an issue that requires special attention as it leads to faster disease progression, high mortality rate and suboptimal response to anti-retroviral therapy. And if they are the bread winners, it could affect the whole family.The nutritional parameters that were observed to have significantly increased among the group that received macronutrient supplement are body weight, body mass index, mid-arm circumference, fat-free mass, and body cell mass. The observation was compared with that of a control group of 79 patients who received only standard care. This group did not show any improvement, and their CD4 count dropped.While the standard care involved treatment to prevent other diseases and treating common infections, by providing multivitamin tablets, nutritional counselling and psychosocial support. The supplement group, meanwhile, also got a mixture of whole wheat and soya bean flour fortified with vitamins and folic acid, providing a high-calorie, high-protein diet.NIRT director Dr Soumya Swaminathan said that though an increase in nutrition levels were observed, they may not be statistically significant. That was partly due to the study design and other biological and behaviourial factors.Scientist C Padmapriyadarsini says that the patients in the ‘beneficiary' group were also given interesting recipes to try out new ways to cook and eat.

And what does a poor, sick mother, desperately trying to ensure that her HIV positive orphaned child gets his essential daily dose of life-saving medicines get? Insensitivity, buck-passing and indolence by the government medical fraternity and the BSACS officials!On Thursday, incidentally observed as AIDS Orphans Day (part of the annual global Aids awareness week), a desperate 25-year-old widow in Chhapra was running from pillar to post in a frantic bid to obtain the next dose of ART for her eight-year-old son. An HIV positive person needs to take the prescribed medicine daily, just like a daily insulin dose for diabetics. If the dose is missed, even for a day, the immune system of the patient starts deteriorating. The people at the ART dispensing centre were helpless, stocks were over (The special ART formulation for children is given in a syrup form). When the woman, in desperation, went to submit a written intimation to the nodal medical officer, pleading that the medicine be made available, she was brushed aside. He refused to accept her application.The woman, a widow, who somehow ekes out a living working in a private school, is distraught. For the past five days, she has abandoned her work, running to and fro the dispensing centre. The irony is that the medication can only be obtained from the government centre and no private chemist shop in Chhapra stocks the medicine, which is very expensive.“I went to get the medicines on the May 4, a day before the last dose ran out (This is the practice. Patients are given medicines for a month only, and they can’t ask for any advance stock). There was no medicine available. My child is on ART since 2011. What’s worrying me is that in January, when a CD-4 count was done, his platelet count had dropped to 311 from 1100. I’m desperate,” she said over the phone.Exactly 14 days ago, I happened to visit the Chhapra ART centre with RTI activist Sanjeet Singh, where the persons concerned told us that stocks were low. “We are just not receiving adequate stocks from BSACS, and we struggle to do what we can,” they said.“The high court has decreed that every ART centre should have a two-month stock of ART medicines and medicines for opportunistic infections, but despite assurances from BSACS officials, see the situation!” says Sanjeet.In Chhapra, the situation is overwhelming. Last month 1748 patients received ART. There are about 150 children on ART. NACO guidelines are not met. BSACS has not appointed the required staff. No medical officer, so obviously, no ‘accountable’ official! Pregnant women have to buy their own ‘safe delivery kits’ from private stores in Patna because the hospital has no stock. HIV positive pregnant women are denied surgery at Chhapra. The official line is, “So far, no such case has been brought to our notice.” There is no CD4 testing machine, even though NACO funds were there for one unit in each district, it is said. The woman says, “My child is the only reason I am living, if he dies, I am nothing, I might as well destroy myself.” Just as I write the finishing line to this article, Saturday 8am, I receive a phone call. The ART medicines have finally arrived, and will be given out today.

The virus was unable to replicate in human cells in vitro.The discovery may have applications in treating cancer, which also has an immense appetite for sugar and other nutrients in the cell, which it needs to grow and spread.""This compound can be the precursor for something that can be used in the future as part of a cocktail to treat HIV that improves on the effective medicines we have today,"" said Harry Taylor, assistant professor in Medicine-Infectious Diseases.HIV needs to grow in a type of immune cell (CD4+ T-cell) that is active, meaning it is already responding to pathogens in the blood.Activation increases the T-cell's supplies of sugar and other critical nutrients needed for both cell and virus growth.Until now, no one knew the first step that signalled a newly activated T-cell to stock up on sugar and other nutrients. Those nutrients become the building blocks of genetic material the cell and the virus need to grow.Northwestern and Vanderbilt scientists figured out that the first step in stocking the T-cell's pantry involved turning on a cell component called phospholipase D1 (PLD1). Then they used an experimental compound to block PLD1 and shut down the pipeline.This is believed to be the first time scientists have targeted the virus's ability to pilfer the cell's pantry to stop its growth.The compound also slowed the proliferation of the abnormally activated immune cells, the study found.Current HIV medications stop HIV growth but do not affect the abnormal excess activation and growth of immune cells triggered by HIV.The excess immune cell growth is believed to contribute to the life-long persistence of HIV and leads to excess inflammation that causes premature organ damage in HIV patients - even when the virus is suppressed by current medicines.""Perhaps this new approach, which slows the growth of the immune cells, could reduce the dangerous inflammation and thwart the life-long persistence of HIV,"" Taylor added.

The National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) has sounded an alert on the unexpected spurt in fresh HIV infections in Punjab and Chandigarh. Experts are calling this 'worrisome' because both regions were seen as low prevalence places compared to other parts of the country.NACO officials believe the jump may be because of an increase in the number of injecting drug users (IDUs), however, there is no data available on such drug users.These numbers have come to light when the Union home minister Rajnath Singh, on his visit to Anandpur Sahib last week, had asked the youth in Punjab to shun drugs. His statement upset the ruling Akali Dal which has said that Punjab is being defamed for fighting the drug menace.NACO's observations have been seconded by another report of the parliamentary standing committee on health and family welfare submitted to the Rajya Sabha in April. It names Assam, Delhi, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Punjab and Uttarakhand as states which have shown a rise in adult HIV prevalence. It also points at reduced funding to NACO which may have shrunk its role in these regions.Dr B B Rewari, national programme officer (antiretroviral therapy), NACO, said, ""The rise is in the last five years. Punjab has more IDUs than the north-eastern states and that is main risk factor for HIV infections.""In fact, Chandigarh, which is often seen as insulated from Punjab's drug problem because of its Union Territory status, has started showing some of the symptoms. A study, 'High risk behaviours of injecting drug users (IDUs) in Chandigarh' says that 48.9% of IDUs shared needles. The study was conducted by A Das Mohapatra, Manmeet Kaur, Rajesh Kumar and P V M Lakshmi of Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research.The prevalence of needle sharing has been reported by various national studies to be 30.3% and 41.9% among IDUs in Haryana and Punjab. ""Chandigarh is not far from Punjab which has a high number of IDUs. So, we are not surprised by the results,"" says Kumar.","['union', 'idus', 'hiv', 'punjab', 'drug', 'prevalence', 'chandigarh', 'fresh', 'naco', 'national', 'cases', 'jump', 'users']","The National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) has sounded an alert on the unexpected spurt in fresh HIV infections in Punjab and Chandigarh.

Over 182 projects that cater to nearly three lakh high-risk population in the state will suffer as distribution of condoms and syringes to availability of medicines and testing kits will take a direct hit.The circular issued on June 11 has asked NGOs and community-based organizations (CBOs) to curtail the strength of their peer educators by 80% and outreach workers by 25%. A majority of these agencies have not received a dime from the state body since January this year, and therefore have been grappling with massive attrition due to non-payment of salaries.The sacking of peer educators and outreach workers will directly impact the distribution of condoms, lubricants and syringes in the state’s most vulnerable pockets. Peer educators are members or leaders who belong to the high-risk community (female sex workers, transgenders and men having sex with men) and carry out the crucial task of distributing condoms and motivating people to get tested.The MSACS in its circular blamed the change in funding pattern of the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) for the delay in receiving funds, which are likely to arrive only by October this year. However, TOI has learned that NACO had released around Rs 8 crore as a contingency measure, which has been lying with the state treasury for the past two months. Project director Khushalsinh Pardeshi could not be reached for comment.MSACS that presented an annual budget of Rs 130.12 crore had received only three-fourths of the money. The annual plan for 2015-2016 of nearly Rs 200 crore is yet to be approved by NACO, which has committed only 80% or less.Maharashtra till date remains one of the six high-risk states in the country with a prevalence rate of 0.40%. According to NACO’s annual report, over 40,000 people had tested positive for HIV in 2013-2014 out of the 20 lakh who were tested, indicating that the HIV scare is still very pertinent.The fund crunch, said to be one of the worst for the state body, has already started affecting people living with HIV. The stock of anti-retroviral medicines that keep nearly 1.80lakh adults and 11,000 children alive is erratic. While NACO provides the ART drugs, MSACS would often financially support NGOS to locally purchase drugs if the drugs did not come on time. “CBOs like us are struggling for existence. Who do you think will worry about some patients not getting medicines on time or progressing to the second line?” asked a Pune-based agency that is thinking of giving up three of its projects.The crisis has also reached the state body’s doorstep. Sources told TOI that the last lot of condoms has already been distributed to NGOs, while consumables required to draw blood and carry out HIV tests are long over at MSACS. Worse, the state body has run out of paper to print HIV test reports at several of its Integrated Centres for Counselling and Testing (ICTC).“It is appalling how a national programme used the services of female sex workers and transgenders and now wants to get rid of them. Many of them have left prostitution to work fully for the programme. What are we going to tell them?” questioned Meena Seeshu, who runs three projects at Sangli. As per the state diktat, 40 of her peer educators stand to lose employment. “We suspect the rate of new infections is already going up,” said a Pune-based NGO’s director. Following the circular, at least two NGOs have communicated to MSACS that they will be withdrawing their projects with female sex workers and migrants.When TOI contacted NACO, a senior official from the finance department said that it is time the state bore some burden of the HIV programme. “We have formed a committee that will negotiate with state governments. We will still be paying most of the money,” the official said. The country’s HIV programme has taken a beating since multilateral organizations, including WHO and several UN agencies such as UNICEF and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), have drastically reduced or diverted funds since 2013.","['peer', 'hiv', 'msacs', 'programme', 'workers', 'sex', 'ngos', 'maharashtra', 'funds', 'naco', 'educators', 'condoms', 'state', '3l', 'risk']","MUMBAI: A practically broke Maharashtra State Aids Control Society ( MSACS ) has asked NGOs to curtail their HIV prevention activities in the state and do away with a significant chunk of their workforce.

Because of the handwritten pamphlet, all her relatives and friends who visited her at the hospital have now come to know of her HIV positive status, adding to the woman's extreme anxiety.When news about the ill-treatment of Meena reached the Care Support Centre (CSC) that fights for the rights of people living with HIV (PLHIVs), members of its district responsible team (DRT), Ritu Saxena and Vinita Devi, went to the hospital where they found the piece of paper still stuck to her bedside.“We immediately tore it off and took the authorities to task. Fearing that the issue might become too big to handle, the hospital staff rushed to control the damage,” Saxena told TOI on Thursday.Hospital authorities confirmed the “unfortunate” incident and said they have apologized to the patient. “I understand this should not have happened but the doctors have given a written apology and the patient has made peace with the staff,” said Abhilasha Gupta, head of the obstetrics and gynaecology department at the hospital.Talking to TOI from her bed, Meena said that she had contracted the disease from her husband eight years ago and had kept it a closely guarded secret. “Due to the negligence of the doctors, it has now become public knowledge,” she said. “Not only did I have to face abuse about my condition, even my girl child was not spared.

After exposing the cells to IL-21, they introduced HIV-1 and found that after 72 hours, cultures with IL-21 contained more than two-thirds less virus than those that didn't receive the treatment.The second model tested IL-21 in mice transplanted with human stem cells to create a physiological environment as close as possible to that in people.Over the course of two weeks, the mice began producing IL-21. After 14 days, more than half of the mice with IL-21 did not display a detectable level of HIV-1.An analysis of the results suggested that IL-21 not only jump starts the immune system but also stops the HIV-1 virus from replicating during a critical, early window of its development, when it is concentrated in one location and has not yet started to spread throughout the body.""This study highlights components of the human immune system that are capable of mounting an antiviral response and driving intrinsic resistance to HIV-1,"" said senior author Dr Laurie H Glimcher, of Weill Cornell Medical College.""We are hopeful that this knowledge will help bring us one step closer to shielding patients from this deadly and complex virus,"" Glimcher said.The reduction in viral load is due to the cascade of events initiated by IL-21.The investigators found that IL-21 instructs CD4 T cells to increase the amount of a small RNA molecule. That molecule, microRNA-29 (miR-29), inhibits the replication of HIV-1, limiting the amount of virus produced from infected cells.""Our study has uncovered a potentially potent arsenal that patients have against the virus. We think IL-21 is one of those arsenals and that deploying it early will be very powerful in fighting the infection,"" said lead author Dr Stanley Adoro, a postdoctoral associate in medicine in Glimcher's lab.The study was published in the journal Nature Communications.","['hiv1', 'hiv', 'cells', 'virus', 'scientists', 'study', 'human', 'mice', 'system', 'immune', 'infection', 'potential', 'il21', 'therapy']","""This study highlights components of the human immune system that are capable of mounting an antiviral response and driving intrinsic resistance to HIV-1,"" said senior author Dr Laurie H Glimcher, of Weill Cornell Medical College.

The humiliation of the couple did not end with the just the notice, as the staff kept addressing the women as “HIV walli” instead of her name.Recounting what he termed as “humiliating days”, the husband said while the staff in the ward addressed all the women with their first names, my wife was called “HIV walli”. He said his requests to the staff to refrain from doing so made no difference and they were made to feel “outcastes” in the ward.Though at present there are no comprehensive laws in India to deal with the menace of discrimination with HIV/AIDS infected people and their rights, India is signatory to various international treaties and agreements that provide for protection and non-discrimination with those suffering from the disease.In fact two legislations, the HIV/AIDS Bill 2007 and Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (Prevention and Control) Bill, 2014, which provide for non-discrimination with those suffering from the disease, are pending clearance in the Parliament.Dubbing the act of the BR Ambedkar hospital staff as “illegal”, experts point out that a HIV positive person has the right to keep his/her HIV/AIDS status confidential. They say that even Courts have upheld that that in case HIV patients do not want to disclose their identity, they can use a pseudonym before even the Courts to suppress their identity. A leading lawyer pointed out that the Bombay High court had ruled that the court would permit HIV positive litigant to suppress his or her identity and prosecute or defend the proceedings under an assumed name.“When the law is clear, then why isn’t it followed in the hospital”, questioned Rinki Arora, president of Chhattisgarh Network of positive. Admitting that it could be in the interest of the staff to know that an individual is an HIV patient, Rinki said the status of the individual could be mentioned on their health sheets and the prescriptions rather than publically declaring her status by putting put a poster and addressing her as “HIV walli”.Rinki said moreover, the infant has yet not be tested for the disease as the same could be conducted only after two months and the subsequent process for confirming the actual status of HIV could take up to 18 months. “The hospital staff has already branded the child HIV positive by the poster on the side of the cradle”, she said.Advocacy officer of Hindustan Latex Family Planning Promotion trust, Amruta Alpesh Soni , who also visited the hospital, said the staff cannot disclose the identity of an HIV patient and it had violated the NACO guidelines by doing so.When contacted, hospital’s public relation officer, Shubhra, said the staff put up the “universal precaution” notice to make duty nurses aware of the patient’s status.

Trouble started brewing at NACO since 2013, when several international agencies started diverting funds from HIV to other diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria and dengue. The NACO, now completely dependent on the central government funds, has been facing financial constraint itself. The crisis became more pronounced with the Centre slashing health budget by 17% last year.Sawant explained that NACO may be looking at 75:25 funding model, which currently exists for other national programmes such as the National Rural Health Mission. “NACO is expecting us to bear 25% of the programme cost. We have told the Centre that the state is already grappling with fund crunch. So, they should grant funds till we can allocate something from the state kitty,” Sawant added. MSACS has a budget of nearly Rs 150 crore that is used to sustain 142 of the 182 targeted intervention projects in the state. “The state programme caters to over eight lakh people, including female sex workers,” said an NGO from Pune that has not received any funds since January.According to the MSACS circular, NGOs have to do away with 80% of the sanctioned strength of peer educators and 25% of outreach workers. On onwe hand, project director of MSACS Khushalsinh Pardeshi has assured that the core prevention activities will not suffer, but on the other hand, he admitted that NACO is behind its schedule of approving the 2015-16 plan for HIV prevention. “NACO has asked state governments to contribute at least 50% of the cost,” he said.Stuck in this confusion are community-based organizations, such as Malwani-based Sakhi Char Chowghi Trust that works towards prevention of HIV among transgender and fear closure now as they are completely dependent on MSACS’s funds. MSACS, meanwhile, is desperately hoping that the state will expedite and release an amount of Rs 11.89 crore sanctioned by NACO, but waiting for cabinet approval. Till then, over 3000 people, many of who are HIV positive, fear loss of livelihood from July.","['cost', 'funding', 'hiv', 'msacs', 'hivcontrol', 'programme', 'health', 'prevention', 'naco', 'funds', 'national', 'state', 'share', 'noncommittal']","Trouble started brewing at NACO since 2013, when several international agencies started diverting funds from HIV to other diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria and dengue.

The hospital and the two doctors have, however, denied any wrongdoing and said they would appeal against the verdict.The lawyer, Subhash Mohanrao Pachlore, of Harsul in Aurangabad, was admitted to the hospital by his wife and relatives on July 11, 2007. He had a history of headaches, giddiness and loss of consciousness. A physician at the hospital, M A Majid, sent Pachlore’s blood sample to a pathology laboratory for the HIV test.Pachlore told the forum that when he was being discharged from hospital three days later, the physician told his wife in the presence of relatives about the laboratory report indicating the HIV-positive status. He said the hospital discharge card also mentioned the HIV positivity.Pachlore took the HIV test again at another pathology laboratory on July 14 but the findings were negative. In 2009, he filed a complaint with district forum against the hospital and the medical practitioners at the hospital and the first laboratory.The forum headed by K N Tungar and comprising of members Sandhya Barlinge and Kiran R Thole observed, “The respondents were negligent in rendering their service to the complainant.

He claimed that after the first HIV test was reactive, it was repeated the same day. “The second finding was negative. Pachlore’s wife was counselled and informed as he was drowsy and irritable. He was discharged after three days,” he said.Majid said Pachlore had faith in the hospital as he got re-admitted for fever three days later. “He has suppressed this fact. Due to poor legal representation, the district forum imposed a fine on us in 2010. We appealed in the state forum and the fine was reduced to Rs 5 lakh. We challenged it in the national forum, which quashed both the orders and sent the matter back to the district forum saying that no proper opportunity was given to the respondents and that no medical expert evidence was taken by the lower courts,” he said.Majid said they had got their deposit with interest on the order of the national forum. “The complainant went to Supreme Court for a stay on the judgment of the national forum, which was dismissed in 2011.

This is in contrast to previous years when the hospital used to get three to four cases of babies born infected with the deadly disease, yearly. This, doctors say, proves the results of prevention of parent to child transmission are finally showing.Prevention of parent to child transmission was introduced in Goa after a significant number of new HIV cases were found to be occurring through the perinatal route— transmission of an illness from mother to child. A change was seen after new guidelines were rolled out by the National Aids Control Organization (NACO) in January 2014.Dr Wanda Viegas, senior medical officer at the antiretroviral therapy (ART) centre at GMC, said that a significant change was seen after they started implementing the new guidelines. Now, a pregnant woman who’s HIV positive is immediately put on ART as opposed to the earlier method of starting treatment in the delivery room after pregnancy. Then, the mother was given a single dose of Nevirapine tablet and the baby a single dose of syrup.ART is a combination of drugs given to HIV-infected persons with CD4 count less than 350. The CD4 count is an indicator of one’s immune system, and a falling CD4 count means a person infected with HIV is exposed to opportunistic infections. Normally, ART treatment for HIV patients is started only after his/her clinical investigation is conducted but Viegas said that in the case of pregnant mothers, they do not wait until the investigation is completed.“The HIV carrier who’s pregnant is immediately put on ART while an investigation is conducted subsequently,” she added. Since April, three pregnant women have been put on the medication.Currently, 280 children are registered with the ART centre, of which 184 children are undergoing ART. “Some of the children going through ART have now attained 18-20 years of age and are doing well,” she said.Doctors say that it is sad as some HIV positive children who have lost one or both parents, are entirely dependant on other members of the family who in most cases, do not care enough. A doctor says, “We have a case of a boy who lost both his parents to AIDS. His visits to the ART center are irregular as his uncle does not give him money to travel.”Some children, mostly above 10 years of age, come to the centre alone to collect their monthly dose of medicines in the absence of a family member to escort them. An HIV positive person taking ART can lead a healthy life provided he/she sticks to a healthy lifestyle and adheres completely to the therapy.","['help', 'drop', 'babies', 'hiv', 'transmission', 'naco', 'positive', 'pregnant', 'art', 'birth', 'count', 'child', 'children', 'state', 'investigation', 'dose', 'guidelines']","PANAJI: Since 2014, 22 babies born to HIV positive mothers at Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, have tested negative.

Noori was told she had tested positive for HIV, a then little known virus that was viciously attacking people around her. “She said I didn’t have much time to live as they had only recently discovered the disease and there was no cure. I was asked to make my life count,” said Noori, a transgender who gave up commercial sex work to help people from her community.The woman who delivered the report to Noori was Dr Suniti Solomon , whose pioneering work in HIV a year earlier had startled the medical fraternity and pushed the government to act. In 1986, Dr Solomon, then a microbiologist at Madras Medical College, and her team for the first time documented evidence of HIV infection in India. Noori was among the second batch of around 135 commercial sex workers from Chennai who were tested. “She didn’t just break down science for us. She taught us to live,” said Noori.For close to three decades Dr Solomon used science to save and make lives, and lost hers to cancer. She passed away at her residence in Chennai on Tuesday morning. She was 76, and is survived by her son Dr Sunil Solomon.“We lost a prolific scientist, a great teacher and a wonderful person who worked tirelessly to bring science to the people,” said Dr Sundar Sundararaman, her student and later her colleague. Born into the illustrious Gaitonde family, Dr Solomon graduated from Madras Medical College. She married eminent cardio-thoracic surgeon Dr Solomon Victor. While Dr Solomon Victor focused on treating poor patients and in 1989 conceived the Rheumatic Heart Ailment project, Dr Suniti Solomon moved beyond research to set up Y R Gaitonde Centre for AIDS Research and Education (YRG CARE), a premier HIV/AIDS care and support centre, in Chennai.“More than the virus itself, Dr Solomon was concerned about the stigma HIV positive people faced,” said Dr D Dhanikachalam, head of technical support unit, Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TANSACS). “When the epidemic was first discovered, people were afraid to go close to those with HIV. She felt the pain they went through and worked to fight not just the virus but the discrimination too,” he said.Trained in pathology in the UK and the US, her experience covered a range of aspects linked to HIV infection, biomedical parameters to socio-economics. She also published papers extensively on HIV epidemiology, prevention, care, support and related gender issues. In 2012, Dr Suniti Solomon was given the Lifetime Achievement Award for Service on HIV/AIDS by the state-run Dr MGR Medical University here.In 2009, the ministry of science and technology conferred the ‘National Women Bio-scientist Award’ on her. In 2001, she was given a similar award for her pioneering work on HIV/AIDS by the state run-medical varsity. A fellow of National Academy of Medical Sciences (NAMS), New Delhi, she had served on several boards, including National Technical Team on Women and AIDS, Advisory Board of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative-India, the Scientific Committee of the National AIDS Research Institute Pune and the Microbicide Committee of Indian Council of Medical Research.“She was a no nonsense person with a high sense of commitment. Her work is testified through hundreds of publications and her contribution is acknowledged across the world. As a teacher, she taught over 25 batches of students in MMC,” Dr Sundararaman.In an earlier interaction with TOI, Dr Solomon had commended the work Tamil Nadu had done in the field of HIV/AIDS and said the state had come a long way in screening, but the programmes had become complacent with counselling. “We have contained the infection to an extent among truckers and female sex workers. But if we become complacent there will be an increase of incidence among these as well,” she had said.People who worked with her are not surprised by her prediction. “She worked tirelessly for the cause not just inside labs but outside as well. If she was concerned, there were obvious reasons,” said a microbiologist, who worked closely with her in the late 90’s. Dr Solomon also said it was unfortunate that despite 30 years of the HIV epidemic and the progress made, there is still no cure or effective vaccine for the infection. “But what is killing people with AIDS more is the stigma and discrimination,” she had said.","['aids', 'worked', 'science', 'noori', 'hiv', 'threat', 'dies', 'dr', 'woke', 'medical', 'national', 'work', 'solomon', 'india', '76', 'suniti']","In 1986, Dr Solomon, then a microbiologist at Madras Medical College, and her team for the first time documented evidence of HIV infection in India.

It is expected to reach over 11crore people across rural and urban India.Naik said that the government has an aggressive intervention programme to combat HIV/AIDS. The unique feature of the anti-HIV programme is that it has always kept the marginalized and high-risk groups as the focus areas. Over 15,000 integrated counselling and testing centres are now functional across the country. Over 410 anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centres provide treatment to about 7.4 lakh HIV patients in India.Naik said that since Goa is a popular tourist destination, it needs a robust strategy. This is an important occasion to reiterate that our prevention service reaches every person.Parsekar said that of the 120 crore people in India, 50% are below the age of 25 and that is why, it is imperative to focus on issues affecting the youth and to understand the challenges they face. Though HIV has declined in Goa in recent years, the government wants to take it to zero level and also do away with the stigma attached to it.Another highlight of the function is the testimonies given by two teenagers from Bengaluru. Babu Seenappa, 14, and Manik Prabhu, 16, both represented India in the international children’s games in Netherlands in June this year. Both are HIV positive and reside at Sneha Care Home, Bengaluru. Seenappa was born with HIV but now competes in 5km and 10km races. Prabhu runs 100m and relays.Speaking about his participation in an international competition, Babu said it was a proud moment for him. “HIV did not stop me and will never stop me from doing anything. Many of my friends have been denied admissions to schools because of their HIV status but we cannot spread infection through normal contact. Let us build a better world free from stigma and discrimination,” he said.","['help', 'stop', 'hiv', 'spread', 'youth', 'treatment', 'provide', 'testing', 'international', 'awareness', 'goa', 'app', 'minister']","The unique feature of the anti-HIV programme is that it has always kept the marginalized and high-risk groups as the focus areas.

The 42-year-old has been an HIV positive since 2004 and initially he was in a bad condition. Doctors too had given up on him. But today, Keshava is leading a dignified life. He could walk over 3km a day without any support.""I did not think I could live. It's only because of self-confidence and moral support that I could survive,"" says Keshava. Initially, he did not take treatment due to financial constraints. He owned a petty shop to sustain his family. In 2011, his health deteriorated and he was bedridden, unable to even move his hands. Doctors sent him back home losing all hope, he added.His mother Sathyavathi says she owes it all to the Swami Vivekananda Youth Movement (SVYM). ""If my son is alive, it's only because of SVYM and its volunteers' moral support,"" she says.Despite his failing health, he did small jobs like starting a mobile recharge shop to support his family.Thanks to the palliative care facility of SVYM, the bedridden patients and their families get support. The facility, apart from taking care of patients, also helps their family members to avail governmental benefits. ""Now, I am receiving widow pension and my son is getting pension from the government. Palliative care volunteers helped me get these benefits,"" said Sathyavathi.The CD4 count in HIV patients should be above 350 but if the count falls below that, patients may become bedridden and the risks are very high, says district AIDS controller Dr T Raghu Kumar. Keshava had CD4 count below 50 when palliative care volunteers visited him in 2012.Like him, more than 300 bedridden needy patients have availed palliative care. Today, some of them are leading a dignified life. ""The goal is to improve the quality of life for patients and their families. The need of palliative care is essential in terminal and chronic diseases as they are incurable and result in physical, psychological, socio-economic strain to individuals and their families,"" says palliative care volunteer Dr Deepak Murthy.The palliative care facility has served 345 bedridden patients suffering from cancer, paralysis, spinal cord injury, severe neurological disorders, hypertension, gangrene, kidney failure, cerebral palsy and other illnesses since 2011. Initially, 88 patients were inducted into the programme.

Shreshtha (name changed), a woman from Kangra district, was thrown out of her house by her in-laws on coming to know about her HIV status. This despite the fact that she was infected by her husband, a truck driver and was forced to live in misery along with her two children. However, she was lucky to get help of village panchayats and a local NGO. Today, she is heading an organization that works in association with panchayati raj institutions to create awareness about HIV positive people. In 2011, she was also awarded the best social worker award.Bhago (name changed), another HIV positive woman from Kangra district, was passed on the infection by her husband. However, the damage catapult as by the time she came to know about her being HIV positive, she had three children from the marriage. She earns her livelihood by working as daily wager and fear of being stigmatized by the society is not letting her reveal her status.Women alone are not the ones to suffer. Sohan Lal (name changed) from Bilaspur was detected with HIV in 1990, but till date he has not revealed his being HIV positive to his relatives and villagers as he fears to he will be ostracized once he reveals the truth.

He said drug abuse is increasing in border areas of the state and that is leading increasing cases of HIV too.He said that recently a meeting was held in which a proposal to provide pension to HIV positive people and bus passes for free travel for treatment was discussed too.A health official said that female sex workers are being provided vocation training and 550 have already been included under livelihood training. Vocation training to them would be provided at Industrial Training Institutes of Nahan, kala Amb, Solan, Bilaspur, Mandi, Shimla, Nalagrh and Baddi.Though Himachal Pradesh falls under the category of low prevalent state where the infection rate among the adult HIV prevalence is 0.17% with total count of positive persons at 8,091, efforts are on to nail down the causes that are resulting in spread of HIV/AIDS.

They refused to attend the monthly review meeting last Saturday. Staffers of ART centres and ICTC centres have also not got their salaries for last month and are joining this campaign.

These NGOs have not been getting any funds to run their projects since January this year. The money, coming from the union government, is supposed to be directed through the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS). Project managers from these organizations had been promised that at least part of the funds will be disbursed by September. While this has not happened, even salaries of the staff working under the MSACS have not been paid for September.

“The meeting on Saturday was a regular review meet in which NGOs are expected to share data and experiences about their monthly activities. This data form the basis for the plans to be made by the government with regards to the awareness activities and the ways to arrest the spread of HIV,” informed programme officer of District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) Tanuja Fale. She admitted that all eight NGOs from the district kept away from the meeting.

Similar meetings took place in all the districts of the state last week. Only 10-15 of the 156 NGOs attended them, most choosing to boycott it. As the salaries of staffers of Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) centres, Integrated Counseling and Testing Centres (ICTC) and DAPCU did not come for the month of September, they have stopped sending monthly reports they send to MSACS. These reports consist of information about the number of medicines taken by the HIV positive people in the district, stock of the medicines available at the centre and people walking in for getting tested for STIS, among other data.

“We have tried several democratic ways of getting the attention of the authorities to our problems. We have only been hearing that the money will come ‘in the next few days’ for the last eight months. We have also written letters to union minister Nitin Gadkari, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule and state health department, none of whom have given anything other than assurances,” said Hemlata Lohave, project manager of the targeted intervention programme at Red Cross Society.

She added that the government would be responsible if the HIV infection rose because of their inattention. This is bound to happen as not only are the awareness programmes for vulnerable population under threat but the People Living with HIV (PLHIV) are also not being catered to properly, said other activists.","['review', 'getting', 'hiv', 'boycott', 'msacs', 'district', 'fundstarved', 'ngos', 'meeting', 'nagpur', 'centres', 'monthly', 'state', 'salaries', 'minister']","NAGPUR: Having got no funding from government for more than nine months now, NGOs working towards spreading HIV-AIDS awareness are launching a non-cooperation movement.

They have already spoken with and written letters to officials from health department, Maharashtra State AIDS Control Organisation (MSACS) and several important leaders of the city. They are worried the government’s inattention towards these projects would lead to spurt in HIV infection, which has been stabilized after much effort.

“Nagpur district is among the places where the rate of infection has fallen very low. In Maharashtra, the rates have fallen from 9% to 0.6% between 2001 and 2015,” informed Pravin Hiware from Noble Shikshan Sanstha of Chandrapur that works among female sex workers (FSW), migrant workers and truckers.

Amit Nagrare from Gaurav Trust of the city said that inconsistent supply of medicines and condoms also affected the rapport that the project managers and counsellors share with the target population. “After this, when the counsellors want to take the people for getting tested for sexually transmitted infections, they refuse. All this makes them more vulnerable,” he said.

“Those who already have HIV also don’t get medicines in time. This can be fatal as their viral load can rise even if one dose of medicines is given late,” said project manager of Red Cross Society Hemlata Lohave.

Anand Chandrani from Sarathi Trust said that either the government must assure us that the funds would be released in time or clearly tell us that the projects do not need to be run anymore.

847,7-11-2015,['Nitasha Natu'],https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg,"GUAYAQUIL: Jean's book of heroes occupies pride of place at a clinic run by Fundacion VIHDA, a non-profit working to prevent transmission of HIV from mother to child in Ecuador's largest city, Guayaquil. One would expect illustrations of princes to jump out of the pages of her book. Instead, there are handmade drawings of her grandmother.Since her mother's death, Jean, who has tested HIV positive, is being looked after by her grandmother. The biggest concern for families like hers is how to break the news to a child about his/her HIV status. This concern prompted Fundacion VIHDA to come up with a programme for diagnostic disclosure of HIV to children and to prepare them for their life ahead. Two years since, 15 children, having an average age of 10 to 12 years, have completed the programme.Globally, 3.2 million children, under the age of 15, were living with HIV in 2013, according to UNAIDS. They comprised 9.1% of all people living with HIV. 240,000 children worldwide acquired HIV in 2013: one new infection every two minutes.""A significant number of kids in Ecuador acquire the HIV virus from their mothers who may not have been able to receive treatment on time to prevent transmission to the child. As kids grow up, they start asking questions. They know how to read signs at hospitals and labels on flasks. It is important for the child to know that he is not sick and that he has rights,"" says clinical psychologist Dr. Claudia Zambrano, one of the founding members of Fundacion VIHDA.Zambrano and her team have individual sessions, every fortnight, for children living with HIV that approach the clinic. A specific action plan is drawn up based on the personal situation of every child. ""We work with the child's personal history, their specific life circumstances and his/her family, in order to address their needs. The children are taught about wholesome health, just like in school. They are given a general idea about medical conditions, concepts like viral load (amount of HIV in a blood sample), drugs and how they react in the body,"" says Zambrano.Group sessions are held with peers after a couple of months so the child gets a support network.Nine-year-old Valentina had stumped a bunch of paramedics at her school when she told them that she had HIV. She had learnt of her diagnosis from her aunt and did not confide in her friends. But when the paramedics started quizzing students about their allergies and medical conditions, Valentina thought it was okay to tell. ""Valentina was nervous when the paramedics spoke to her teachers. I went over to her school and met the authorities. We spoke to Valentina and strengthened the feeling that there was nothing wrong with her,"" said Zambrano. After that episode at school, things changed as Valentina's teachers and principal were more open to the topic. Valentina continued two years more in the same school and is now in college. She comes regularly to the Fundacion VIHDA clinic and discusses updates in her life as a teenager, occasionally attending some of the group sessions held for younger kids living with HIV.The diagnostic disclosure programme has no fixed duration. ""Kids come to us at different stages. Some of them approach us in crisis after getting to know of their diagnosis in difficult situations. In such cases, we have to work on repair and stress on the fact that although the HIV status is an integral aspect of the child's life, it does not define him as a person. We seek family support and also counsel families on tackling the situation,"" says a member of the psychological counselling team at Fundacion VIHDA. Children in crisis are burdened with a lot of questions and anxieties. They know they have greater physical restrictions than other kids their age. Some of them fear they would die like their mother did. Others are worried that they would get sick often and may not have money to pay for medication in future. ""Children are taught to keep information about their health situation private and not disclose it to any of their friends or acquaintances. But there have been situations where classmates or teachers have found out and started discriminating against them. In such cases, parents or grandparents are encouraged to deal with the situation firmly as we have laws against discrimination of people living with HIV. The child may change schools to overcome discrimination. They work very hard to regain self-esteem and overcome that episode,"" says Zambrano.At Enrique Sotomayor, the largest maternity hospital in Guayaquil where 20% of Ecuador's children are born, a team headed by Dr. Mercedes Ortiz have been fighting to bring down the number of mother-to-child transmissions, despite scarce resources and cultural stigma against HIV. ""The risk of transmission from mother-to-child can occur during pregnancy, breastfeeding or birth. We provide information to all our female patients on why it's important to get tested for HIV and how to prevent transmission of the virus to their babies,"" says Ortiz.From the moment of diagnosis, antiretroviral (ARV) medication has to be administered to the pregnant woman and it has to continue indefinitely. Prior to the birth of the child, these ARVs reduce the amount of virus in the bloodstream and prevent transmission from mother-to-child. On birth, babies must be given infant antiretrovirals during the first month of their life and they have to remain under medical observation till they are 18.(This article was supported by the International Reporting Project.

The US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has approved Genvoya — a fixed-dose combination tablet containing elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide — as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and paediatric patients aged 12 and above.Though the drug is currently not available in India, experts say approval in the US is a major breakthrough and may trigger trials for the medicine in India, which has the third highest number of HIV-infected people in the world. Currently, India has over 20 lakh people living with HIV, while there are around 1.5 lakh children infected with the virus. Though India demonstrated an overall reduction of 57% in the annual new HIV infections among adults, it still witnesses around 1.2 lakh new infections and 1.5 lakh AIDS-related deaths every year.“Today’s approval of a fixed dose combination containing a new form of tenofovir provides another effective, once-daily, complete regimen for patients with HIV-1 infection,” said Edward Cox, director of the Office of Antimicrobial Products at USFDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.According to USFDA, Genvoya contains a new form of tenofovir that has not been previously approved. This new form provides lower levels of drug in the bloodstream, but higher levels within the cells, where HIV-1 replicates. “It was developed to help reduce some drug side effects ,” the regulator said.According to USFDA, the new drug also appears to be associated with less kidney toxicity and decreases in bone density than previously approved tenofovir-containing regimens based on laboratory measures.The American regulator has approved the medicine for children weighing at least 35 kilograms (77 pounds) who have never taken HIV therapy and HIV-infected adults whose HIV-1 virus is currently suppressed.The drug, not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment, will also carry a ‘Boxed Warning’ alerting patients and healthcare providers that the drug can cause a buildup of lactic acid in the blood and severe liver problems, both of which can be fatal. The ‘Boxed Warning’ also states that Genvoya is not approved to treat chronic hepatitis B virus infection.The drug should not be prescribed with other antiretroviral products as it may have drug interactions with a number of other commonly used medications.","['hiv1', 'fda', 'hiv', 'approved', 'virus', 'drug', 'patients', 'usfda', 'lakh', 'tenofovir', 'india', 'effects', 'breakthrough', 'approves', 'fewer']","NEW DELHI: A new treatment for HIV infection has been approved by US federal regulators which does not have the side effects associated with other drugs used to fight the virus that causes AIDS.

In fact, doctors and NGOs dealing with HIV+ adolescents are faced with new problems, such as how to explain and make HIV-affected children understand that they need to lead a controlled life as they become adults. That they will not be able to enjoy life on par with their counterparts. Many of them think “being HIV” means they will die soon and are in a hurry to live life to the fullest extent such as partying hard or being in a relationship.

Dr Vanda Viegas, senior medical officer at ART center located in Goa medical college (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, said though they have had good results with children, who were put on ART since the centre started in the year 2005, they are now posed with more complex problems. “The problem is getting more complicated as most are orphans brought up in the orphanages and are now on their own,” she said.

They have similar urges and desires like other adolescents of their age, but, the only difference is that they have a deadly ailment. There is also a tendency among HIV-positive children to give up education once they learn about their disease. “They want to freak out and do everything possible before death catches up with them,” said Viegas.

Though some may be keen to do higher studies, she said they might not excel for the disease is likely to affect their IQ. Few are into college education, nonetheless. Peter Borges, secretary, Positive People, an NGO working for people afflicted with HIV/AIDS, said life for such children is not easy. Last week, a three-day workshop was held in Valpoi for HIV children,, who were informed about their ailment and were counselled on various aspects. They were also informed about various career options and how to go about it, and also given tips on stress management.

A counsellor, who has been counselling HIV patients, for a while, said counselling children with HIV is a tough job. Children with no parents or parents or a guardian going astray are high once they grasp the magnitude of their disease fully. “They want to be like other youth. Though we do warn them about perils of their action, we suspect some get into relationship without revealing to their partners about their ailment,” he said.

Viegas said, in recent times, she has come across three-four cases wherein relatives of HIV-positive girls got them married outside Goa. “In none of the cases, the groom or his family was informed about the HIV status of the bride,” she pointed out.

The end result has been tragic. After marriage, the girls stopped taking ART to hide the disease, and consequently progression of HIV virus in them was faster.

“They wanted to hide their ailment from their families, but, the arrangement didn’t work. They were thrown out by their respective families,” she pointed out. When some reported back at the ART center, they were in stage four, with full blown AIDS.","['various', 'ailment', 'life', 'getting', 'hiv', 'complex', 'goa', 'disease', 'virus', 'ngos', 'informed', 'teens', 'art', 'children', 'docs', 'tackling']","PANAJI: Although antiretroviral therapy (ART), a medication to decelerate the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has proved effective for over 250 HIV+ children in Goa, the problem is far from over.

""It's a hard three letters to absorb. It's a turning point in one's life,"" the 50-year-old actor said. Here are things you should know about Sheen’s HIV disclosure.

1. The Blackmails Sheen said he made the announcement to end a smear campaign and extortion efforts. Sheen said he's trusted the diagnosis with people he thought he could confide in, but has paid out upwards of $10 million to keep the illness a secret.

2. Clueless about the virus Sheen said he was diagnosed roughly four years ago, but doesn't know how he contracted the virus. ""It started with what I thought was a series of crushing headaches,"" he said. ""I thought I had a brain tumor. I thought it was over.""

3. Confessions

He also insisted it was ""impossible"" that he knowingly transmitted the virus to others. While he admitted to having unprotected sex with two people since the diagnosis, both were informed ahead of time and have been under the care of his doctor. But Sheen dismissed the idea that he engaged in high-risk behaviors.

4. HIV +, not AIDS HIV is the virus that leads to AIDS, which has no cure. But ""Charlie does not have AIDS,"" said the actor's physician, Dr. Robert Huizenga, an associate professor of clinical medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles. While an HIV-positive diagnosis used to be considered a death sentence, and there still is no cure, medical advancements have helped turn it into a manageable illness. However, antiviral drugs must be taken for a lifetime.

5. Medications

Sheen revealed he takes four pills every day, and his doctor said the main battle facing the actor is not related to HIV, but relapsing into substance abuse problems or entering into depression related to his diagnosis. ""Magically, somehow in the midst of incredible personal mayhem, he's managed to continue to take these medications,"" Huizenga said.

6. Public Support Sheen said he hopes by going public with the diagnosis, it will help dispel the stigma of HIV. ""I have a responsibility now to better myself and to help a lot of other people and hopefully with what we're doing today others will come forward and say, 'Thanks, Charlie,'"" he said.

7. Decided to reveal the family Sheen said he told ex-wives Denise Richards and Brooke Mueller about the diagnosis when he found out. He also shared the news recently with his oldest daughter. ""It hit her hard, but she recovered. She's tough like her dad,"" he said.

8. TV journey Sheen rose to become one of Hollywood's best-known actors through a series of memorable movie roles including 'Wall Street' and 'Red Dawn'. In more recent years, however, his public persona was shaped by a public meltdown during his 2011 feud with the creator of 'Two and a Half Men', the television series that helped him become the highest-paid television actor at the time. In the end, Sheen was fired from the show. He told Lauer that his behavior at the time had little to do with his diagnosis.

9. Regrets Sheen admitted that period was not one he looks back fondly on. ""There's a lot out there I'm not proud of. You can only hear 'winning' in the streets so many times,"" he said. ""I've pissed off a lot of really good opportunities"".","['aids', 'disclosure', 'diagnosis', 'charlie', 'hiv', 'virus', 'thought', 'know', 'lot', 'public', 'sheens', 'series', 'sheen', 'india', 'times', 'things']","Charlie Sheen revealed he is HIV positive in an exclusive TODAY interview with Matt Lauer.

But this isn’t the first time a celeb has made such an announcement; there are others who are living with the life threatening disease, and most importantly, helping others cope with it too.The former NBA star was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1991 and since then he has not only controlled the virus from progressing into AIDS through strict medical and exercise regime, but has also become one of the most vocal activists lending support to HIV infected people. Immediately after Sheen announced that he’s HIV positive, Magic Johnson tweeted: “I wish @CharlieSheen and his family the best. With the advancement in treatments and medicine he can fight this disease and live a long life. In breaking his silence, I hope he joins me in educating the world about HIV/AIDs.”The former Frankie Goes to Hollywood frontman was diagnosed with the illness in 1991 and thought he would be the latest in a long line of famous faces who fell victim to AIDS. However, he has fought for his health tooth and nail and survived. Although it’s not exactly been a bed of roses. He confessed in an interview: “I live like a nun. I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, I haven’t done for years. I take copious amounts of vitamins and medications. I do everything possible to support my health. But I’m not whining about it, and I never will.”Olympic diver Greg Louganis was diagnosed with HIV at 28 and he has gone on record to say that he didn’t think he would survive beyond 30. Fit and fine at 55, now he has put the criticism levied at him for his head injury in 1988 Olympics behind him, wherein he was accused of putting divers to the risk of HIV. It cost him dearly with no sponsor willing to support him. Today, Louganis, a staunch supporter of those fighting HIV/AIDS, is going all out to support Sheen. “It can happen to anybody. Viruses are indiscriminate and opening up the dialogue and especially being in the public’s eye is a positive thing,” he said in an interview.Mexican-American fashion designer Mondo Guerra has been breaking barriers and stigmas regarding living with HIV ever since coming out as positive five years ago on Project Runway. While the 38-year-old Denver native is very open about living with HIV now, it wasn’t always the case.“It was hard for me to have this revelation and tell my story because I was scared. I felt very ashamed. I was very embarrassed,” he said in an interview and added, “When I was diagnosed with HIV, I felt like I had failed, so it was very hard for me to talk about it.”For latest Hollywood updates, follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain For the latest in Hollywood news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain The child star of 80s sitcom Who’s the boss, Pintauro was applauded after opening up about his HIV-positive diagnosis recently at Oprah’s show. He received public support from many including his former co-star Tony Danza. Now it is his turn to give full support to Sheen, and he said, “Charlie has made the right decision by sharing his truth. It took me 12 years to get to a place where I was ready to tell the world, but in all of that time I worried that someone else would want to tell my story without my permission, which is why I decided it was time to take control of my story and sit down with Oprah. I commend Charlie for realising it was time to take control of his story.”","['living', 'hiv', 'celebs', 'world', 'latest', 'positive', 'conquered', 'hollywood', 'sheen', 'diagnosed', 'tell', 'support']","American actor Charlie Sheen has sent shockwaves across the world with his confession of being HIV positive.

The child's mother, ironically an NGO worker engaged in HIV awareness, has resolved that if her son does continue studies, it will be at Deepsikha or not at all. The grandmother, who is a Bengali teacher in the very school, had to undergo HIV test to prove she was not a carrier before being allowed to continue.Shaan's mother Sujata learned about his condition mid-January when he was tested after she herself had tested positive the previous month. Her husband Sanjit had earlier been detected HIV+ in May 2014. Though devastated by the test result, Sujata who is engaged in awareness on HIV and AIDS for an NGO decided to immediately inform the school headmaster on ethical grounds.“Since my son studies with others, it is important that the teachers know about it so that if he is hurt and suffers a cut leading to blood loss, he is handled carefully and does not infect others. Sanjib Naskar, the headmaster, was extremely nice and assured me that he would personally ensure that Shaan did not face any trouble,” she recounted.Life carried on as usual till June when Sujata received a bolt from the blue. Naskar called her one day and told her that her son could not study in the school any longer as other guardians were opposed to it.“I didn't even know that word had got around and everyone knew Shaan's condition. When I reminded the headmaster about the assurance, he pleaded helplessness as he was under pressure. No amount of reasoning helped,” she said. Though Sujata did send him to school the following day, he was not allowed entry. Shaan has stayed home since.Sujata alleged that a school teacher even telephoned her and rebuked her for trying to questioning the headmaster's decision. “No one has any idea about HIV. When I tried to explain that other kids were not at threat, they refused to listen and remained adamant,” she said.The ingorance is such that Shaan's grandmother, a Bengali teacher in the school, was forced to undergo blood tests and allowed to continue only after the results were negative.When TOI asked the headmaster why he had reneged on his assurance, Naskar did a U-turn and said that he hadn't shut the door on Shaan but had only informed his mother about the objections from other guardians. “I want him to attend school but the parents are not sending him. But it is true that over 100 guardians signed a petition and submitted to me for Shaan's removal from the school,” he said.On an after-thought, Naskar added that the child's fees were also due for several months. Sujata acknowledged that fees had not been paid for several months but claimed it was because the headmaster had waived the fees.District magistrate PB Saleem said he was aware of the mother's complaint and had asked the block development officer to conduct a thorough enquiry into it to ascertain the facts. “Whatever be the case, the child's education must not be affected. I will do whatever it takes to get him back to school,” he said.","['shaans', 'hiv', 'boy', 'sujata', 'headmaster', 'school', 'naskar', 'son', 'mother', 'kolkata', 'guardians', 'teacher', 'driven']","KOLKATA: A seven-year-old boy has been hounded out of a private school in southern suburb Bishupur by guardians of other students after his mother voluntarily declared that he was HIV+.The student—Shaan—has been studying in the Bengali-medium Deepsikha Nursery School that has students up to class III.

The friend from over two decades ago, was trying to give his old buddy de-addiction treatment. The HIV positive man is said to have done this to avenge this 'care' shown by his friend.

The incident occurred late on Sunday night when Zaheer Modan (37) was going to drop his HIV infected friend to his home in Juhapura when the latter pushed the syringe into Modan. Feeling the pain, Modan asked his friend about it and later found the used syringe from the man's pockets. The drug-addicted man also confessed to having pinched the syringe.

According to Modan, Ehsan (name changed) was his friend for 22 years. Five years ago, Ehsan went to New Zeeland for work but he had started consuming hashish and other drugs there. Under the influence of drugs, he once fought with his employer and landed in jail for two years. After completion of his sentence, the New Zealand government deported Ehsan to India.

Ehsan did not leave his drug habit. He soon started taking drugs using syringes. His father died from the shock and his mother went insane. She was later taken to New Zealand by Ehsan's sister.

Modan stayed with Ehsan like a family-member and even admitted his friend to a de-addiction centre a couple of time. Ehsan did not stay the course and left the treatment programme without completing it.

Modan said Ehsan came to his house two days ago and told him that he had started working with the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), but as he was not paid for two months, he had vandalized his employer's office which led to a police complaint being lodged against him. He pleaded with Modan to help him get anticipatory bail.

On Sunday Modan had advised Ehsan to go to the concerned police station and assured him that they would secure his bail later. Modan again advised him to get over his addiction if he really wanted to avoid troubles in his life. After their conversation, Ehsan asked Modan to leave him at a rickshaw-stop on his bike. According to Modan, a common friend had once told him to let Ehsan remain in jail for some time so that he could leave his addiction. Ehsan had kept this in mind, and it led him to commit the heinous act.","['later', 'syringe', 'hiv', 'used', 'friend', 'ehsan', 'man', 'drugs', 'leave', 'started', 'modan', 'backstabs']","AHMEDABAD: In a bizarre incident, an HIV infected man, a drug addict, plunged his used syringe into his friend's backside.

Further, during the March 2014 to March 2015 period, 14,548 new HIV cases were detected of the total of 77,893 people, who were tested for the disease in Telangana with a prevalence rate of 1.84%.This startling data was revealed by officials of the Telangana State Aids Contro l Society on the sidelines of a World AIDS Day event, organized by United States Consulate General, Hyderabad on Friday evening to honour both private and public sector health practitioners involved in the prevention of HIVAIDS.Given the grim situation at hand, TSACs clearly will have a tough time in achieving the `Getting to zero' target ­ incidentally the theme of World AIDS Day-2015 to be observed on December 1. “In order to achieve the goal, we need to reach out to people who have not undergone the HIV test yet by taking up activities like education and communication (IEC), besides providing treatment and counselling to those who tested positive,“ said Dr John Babu, additional project director, TSACS. However, NGOs and health practitioners working on prevention of HIVAIDS, who attended the recent event in the city , said that there were several challenges that needed to be met before reaching the destination. “The syllabus being taught to medicos will not provide them with an opportunity to gain hands on experience on treatment of HIV patients. This has resulted in decline in interest among general physicians to practice HIV medicine,“ said Dr Dinakar, director, internal medicine, Sunshine Hospital.Similarly , Swapna, vice-president of the NGO Telugu Network of People Living with HIVAIDS working in the states of Telangana and AP, said how the civil society's failure in shunning the stigma attached to HIV patients is proving to be a blockade in providing treatment to them. “I took a bold step in 2003 when I revealed my HIV positive status. Now, our NGO has a network of three lakh positive people in the two states,“ said Swapna.Meanwhile, earlier in his address, Michael C Mullins, consul general, consulate general of the United States of America, Hyderabad, said that U S President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) is working closely with the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) in various areas of HIV AIDS prevention in India like drugs, treatment, testing etc.“It's time to act now.

Till now, in India, only those with a CD4 cell count of less than 350 are started under the ART programme. The NACO, for the first time in over a decade, has decided that the lifesaving antiretroviral drugs will now be offered to even those with a slightly higher CD4 count of 500. CD4 cell count is a crucial marker of how aggressively the virus is destroying the body’s immune system.

“We have to look into the evidence of starting ART for all. More than evidence, it is operational feasibility, finances, human resource and how the ART centres will cope with the increased load of more patients,” said Dr BB Rewari, national programme officer (ART), NACO. On WHO’s recommendations, he said the guidelines are never meant to be adopted immediately. “It is expected to take a year or two,” he said.

With the tweaking of CD4 requirement, over 2-3lakh HIV patients, who earlier did not qualify for the free ART therapy, are likely to be brought under its ambit. Currently, only 8 lakh people in the country are on the ART programme, even though the total number of people living with HIV in India is estimated to be 21 lakh.

Physicians firmly believe that the way forward is early initiation of ART in all adults, adolescents and children with HIV. Dr George Oomen, infectious diseases specialist, said there is ample evidence to show that people who have started ART at their highest CD4 count, be it 750 or 1,000, do best.

Head of medicine at Parel’s KEM Hospital Dr AR Pazare reiterated, “That is the way world is treating HIV. Why wait for the person to become too sick or for his CD4 count to fall so much?” He said early ART can not only stop progression of disease but also cut down on transmission.

Parallel to the CD4 debate is that of providing oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent acquisition of HIV. Ashok Row Kavi of Humsafar trust, that works with men having sex with men, said PrEP has been in use in India for the last few years, but its inclusion in national programme may not be a reality soon. “There is an ideological debate on whether to provide ART to gay men as a preventive drug or first reach out to all women and kids,” he added.

Agricultural labourers and housewives were among the majority to be infected, highlighting the need for strengthening the HIV programme, which is going through a severe fund crunch.An analysis by the Maharashtra State Aids Control Society ( MSACS ) found that young people contributed to 42% fresh infections, while 6% were adolescents. It showed that 28,925 people tested positive for HIV out of the 21.37 lakh tested. Despite a constant decline in new infections across the state, young adults and adolescents, particularly in rural pockets, continue to be the most vulnerable due to lack of adequate knowledge or access to it.Women accounted for 56% new infections, while it was 43% among men and 1% in the transgender community. But the trend in Mumbai is the opposite, where most infections are still seen in men, and only 36% are detected in women. The study showed how education played a pivotal role in an individual getting the infection. About 29% who contracted the virus were illiterate and 35% had primary education. The graph dropped to 28% among those who completed secondary education and to 8% for those with college degrees and above.Infectious disease consultant Dr Om Srivastava said people in their early teens and pre-20s are the most vulnerable due to limited access to information or resources. “There is an element of irresponsibility for those beyond 20-22 as they have access to funds, resources and information,” he said. Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors ( MARD ) president Dr Sagar Mundada said pre-marital testing should be promoted on a larger scale.The highest infection (42%) was detected in the 36-50 age group. Incidentally, a year-on-year increase in this age group has been noted in Kolhapur. HIV in the 51-60 age group stood at 8% and among senior citizens 3%. Dr Shobhna Tehra of MSACS said, “The disease is well under control. Our testing has doubled and infections have halved.” Fresh infections have declined by 45% over the last five years in the city. Among the newly-infected, 78% are aged 15-49, said Dr Shrikala Acharya, additional project director, Mumbai District Aids Control Society ( MDACS ). Around 93% of the infections were due to unsafe sex.But an expert said, “The cloud of uncertainty has to be cleared from the programme that is struggling with demotivated workers and high attrition.” The MSACS has received only Rs 11.89 crore for the year despite having an approved budget of Rs 104.73 crore from the National Aids Control Organisation ( NACO ).","['worst', 'hit', 'mumbai', 'hiv', 'youngsters', 'msacs', 'dr', 'infections', 'maharashtra', 'mahas', '201415', 'young', 'education', 'control', 'group']","Mumbai: Young people in Maharashtra aged 18-35 accounted for a substantial number of new HIV infections in 2014-15.

When her husband – who works in Mumbai to provide for his family – came back home this Diwali, she insisted on an HIV test before he entered home. But, her husband wouldn’t agree. So, Anita decided he would not let him share her bed till he was in Udaisarai.Vidya, another resident of this village and a mother of two, too would not allow her husband Ram Kishore enter home till a blood test showed he was HIV negative.Not that Anita and Vidya were not happy that their husbands were home for Diwali. But, they were scared that they could get with them more them the money and Diwali gifts for all. They were afraid the men may get them disease and death – carrying back home with them the deadly HIV.The women in this village, where most make members work in Mumbai for a living, have united and are fighting this virus in a unique way: They are making the menfolk – through persuasion and even force – under a test to check for HIV as soon as they reach the village from Mumbai.Their fears aren’t misplaced. For, Udaisarai was like any other village in Uttar Pradesh – surviving on income from agriculture and money orders from men working in Mumbai and other cities in western India – till a screening camp 10 years ago made their world turn topsy turvy.Results of blood tests in the camp revealed most of the males were carrying the deadly virus.The village, with a population … and with members from about 200 homes working in other states, has lost as many as 44 people in the past decade.With death staring them in the face, women have taken strong steps. And, if the wives are ensuring HIV tests for husbands and safe sex, they are being supported by their mothers-in-law and sisters-in-law.“We are helping them save themselves from the scourge of infection and stigma. This Diwali, the women told the men to get themselves tested for HIV when the returned home,” said Gyan Swaroopa, an anganwadi worker who has played a key role in spreading awareness in the village.It was Vidya who took the lead and made her husband undergo a blood test at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre at the Fatehpur district hospital.“I have seen members of families which got infected die one by one. Even medicines do not work. The trauma is unbearable. So, I asked my husband to get himself checked,” said Vidya.But not all spouses are cooperative. Anita had to struggle to make her husband take the test. “I did not let him into my room for two days as he refused to take the test. I even did not let him share my bed for the rest of the days,” she said.“It was my mother-in-law who made him agree, reminding him of the deaths village have died. Village elders too convinced him and he donated his sample before leaving for Mumbai. The report is awaited,” she added.When Sangeeta’s husband came home for Diwali, it was her sister-in-law, who herself had lost her husband, who convinced him for the test. Sangeeta’s family heaved a sigh of relief when he turned out to be HIV negative. Sangeeta had stopped communicating with her husband till he agreed.But, when Rekha , who was married just about six months ago, could not convince her husband for the test, she ensured that he used condoms.But not all had it easy. When another resident Rani Devi insisted that her husband underwent a test, he retorted: “Tum humko bataogi ki kya karna hai (Will you tell me what I should do?).”ASHA worker Karuna Devi said threat of importing HIV infection fromMumbai still looms over the hamlet. Village head Dharam Raj revealed that at least 250 residents from 200 families worked in Mumbai and came back home only on festivals.“No one knows what these men do when they are far away, living alone. We counsel youth and men when they leave Fatehpur for work. The stand taken by the women of the village is laudable,” said village pradhan Dharam Raj.Elders who work in Mumbai also keep an eye on the younger men. “Instead of staying on the streets, we get together and pool in money to rent common rooms. This has minimized men visiting commercial sex workers,” said Ramesh Kumar , who has been working in Mumbai since 1999.Social organisations working in HIV prevention in the village are also helping empower women.

On the other, there seems to be a reduction in the central government funds to NACO (National AIDS Control Organisation) for AIDS control programmes and IEC activities (information, education and communication) undertaken through the various SACS (State AIDS Control Society).According to officials of the AP State AIDS Control Society (APSACS), in 2014-15, 32,190 new HIV cases were identified in the state with Guntur, East Godavari and Krishna being the most vulnerable districts mainly due to presence of high number of migrants and truckers. Between April to September 2015, 4,00,090 got tested, out of which 12,742 were confirmed as HIV positive in AP. Currently, 1,28,760 people are living with HIV and are under medication in AP, among which 11,566 are from Vizag district. ""In accordance with the theme of 'Getting to Zero- Zero New HIV Infections, Zero Stigma and Discrimination, Zero AIDS Related Deaths', the overall incidence of HIV/AIDS is coming down in the state but we still don't have a comparative statistics yet as the entire data of the combined state is with Telangana and we are trying to get the AP data post bifurcation. Even then, if we compare the overall prevalence among the high risk groups at present with those three-four years ago, we find that in almost all cases, the prevalence rate has come down,"" stated additional project director (APD) of APSACS Rajendra Prasad.""In ante-natal women, the prevalence rate is 0.1% now as compared to more than 1.5% three-four years earlier. Similarly, in female sex workers, it has come down from 8% to 4% and in MSMs (men who have sex with men) it's 8% as compared to 10% three years ago. Only in case of Injectable Drug Users (IDUs), the cases have gone up from 8% to 10%. We are trying to implement employer-need models in industries to generate awareness among workers too. We also feel the need for generation of continuous awareness and more IEC activities, which has slowed down,"" Prasad said.Speaking on IEC and other issues, an official from Naco working with State Aids Control Society, requesting anonymity, said, ""There's some problem regarding availability of funds to fight AIDS. The combined state of AP-Telangana got Rs 115 crore in 2014. But this year, only Rs 94 crore has been given by the Centre. In fact, the central government has asked the respective state governments to contribute 20 per cent of the funds. Given the fund crunch in the two states, such a move may hamper AIDS control programmes.

Without a solid safe framework, the body experiences difficulty fending off malady.HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It is the virus that can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS. HIV is a virus spread through certain body fluids that attacks the body’s natural immune system. The damage to the immune system makes it harder and harder for the body to fight off infections and some other diseases. Here are a few signs and symptoms of HIV which you should look out for.One symptom that comes in the very beginning is fever known as Acute Retroviral Syndrome (ARS). Fever is ordinarily accompanied with symptoms like tiredness and body torment.At the point when the infection enters the blood, the vulnerable immune system is hit. Likewise, aggravation because of poor immunity causes exhaustion and fatigue.Rash is the most common symptom of HIV. For a person with HIV, the skin can become extremely sensitive to irritants and sunlight. This effect can show up at the beginning or at a later stage. On the off chance that the skin rash isn't effortlessly treated then it could be because of the HIV infection The people suffering from HIV or those who have just fallen sick with HIV generally lose weight rapidly due to the above symptoms.Dry cough should be immediately treated with common treatments. If it is done so, this persistent coughing can lead to pneumonia, which is a sign of the HIV virus.These squeamish inclinations which are not effectively treated could suggest HIV contamination.Lymph nodes shape some portion of the resistant framework which is our immune system. When the immune system is tainted by HIV virus, the lymph nodes get inflamed giving a sign of HIV disease.HIV infected individuals also experience night sweats. This symptom is very similar to women entering menopause.There are a few ways which may help you beat the HIV virus. Here we have mentioned those natural ways that you can add into your daily life and habits to stay safe from the HIV virus.Fast for at least 1 day a week. Drink only the concoction made of distilled water, lemon juice and honey.Eat predigested proteins for maximum digestion. Products like soy milk contain soy protein and yogurt culture, and are great for health as well.Eat cultured proteins like yogurt made from soy milk, that is easily absorbed and digested, and contains acidophilus. This friendly flora produces lactic acid which destroys the bad bacteria.Take protein digestive enzymes if you eat hard to digest proteins like meat, eggs, fish or fowl.Eliminate those proteins from the diet that are hard to digest, like casein from dairy products and gluten’s from wheat and, coagulated proteins from like in fried meats.","['signs', 'soy', 'hiv', 'body', 'virus', 'symptoms', 'proteins', 'system', 'treated', 'immune', 'infection', 'symptom', 'main']","HIV (human immunodeficiency infection) is an infection that attacks our body's immune system, the body's natural protection framework.

TOI is naming Daisy since she wanted to be identified.When the recent flood wreaked havoc with the lives of many in the city, Daisy got an opportunity to return to her old job which she had to quit after testing HIV positive. She tested blood samples of flood-affected people in the medical camps organised by an NGO in many parts of the city.Back in 1997, after the blood bank of the hospital where Daisy worked ran out of stock during an emergency operation, the staff was requested to donate blood.

ALCL is very difficult to diagnose because it is so rare. One needs to have a very high index of suspicion to diagnose this,"" said oncologist Padmaj Kulkarni of Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital, where the woman is being treated.Anaplastic large cell lymphoma of bone is extremely uncommon and only sporadic case studies are available in literature till date. ""The last case of this disease in an HIV infected patient was reported in ""Proceedings of Baylor University Medical Centre"" in 2015. The Pune woman is perhaps the 60th patient worldwide. It is rare even in non-HIV patients,"" Kulkarni said.Ameet Dravid, infectious diseases and HIV specialist from Pune, has been treating the woman. ""The woman came to me with complaints of fatigue and night sweating, back and neck pain and weight loss of five kg in a month. Her X-ray showed multiple lytic lesions and erosion of the bony areas in ribs while CT scan of chest and abdomen showed multiple osteolytic lesions showing severe bone loss in most vertebrae, ribs, both hips and sacroiliac joints which were suggestive of a cancer.""Biopsy taken from her pelvic bone showed anaplastic large cell Non-Hodgkins lymphoma (ALCL). ""This cancer is very rare in HIV positive patients. In fact, in our series of 1,261 patients who had HIV with cancer, 30 were diagnosed with cancer. B-cell lymphomas were commonest while the woman is the only patient with ALCL,"" Dravid said.The woman was admitted to Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital in the second week of December last year for pain control, feeding and other supportive care. Her nuclear medicine imaging (PET-CT) scan was also unique as it showed that only bones were affected with no lymph nodes or any other organ being involved.The patient was put on chemotherapy. ""It was very difficult to give her the right dose of chemotherapy as low dose would not control her cancer while a high dose might lead to death. Her treatment is on and she has, so far, responded very well. She doesn't have severe pain and she comes walking for treatment and is now tolerating full dose of chemotherapy, which is the only treatment available for this type of cancer, ""Kulkarni said.Haematologist Sameer Melinkeri said, ""Patients with HIV infection commonly develop the more common B cell lymphomas. It is distinctly unusual for such patients to develop T cell lymphomas such as ALCL. The treatment for this patient is going to be a challenge since literature is scarce regarding the best line of treatment.""Oncologist Tushar Patil of Sahyadri Specility hospitals said, ""The most common form of lymphoma in HIV affected patients is 'Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and in late stages when CD 4 (type of white blood cell that fights infection) count drops to very low levels, we usually encounter Burkitt's lymphoma. ALCL in these patients is extremely rare though the management will still be same as ALCL in non-HIV patients. It is necessary to continue anti HIV treatment along with chemotherapy .""","['rare', 'cell', 'pune', 'afflicts', 'cancer', 'woman', 'patients', 'lymphoma', 'patient', 'treatment', 'alcl', 'hiv']","A 38 year old HIV infected woman from the city has been diagnosed with a rare cancer which has only 59 known patients worldwide Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) is an extremely rare type of cancer involving immune system cells.

The survey findings were released to the media on Friday.The state's mining and industrial pockets areas continue to record high prevalence of HIV cases despite numerous government intervention schemes.The findings, which are based on screening camps and integrated counseling and testing centres (ICTC) in 23 districts (excluding Garhwa), have recorded 1,496 positive cases in the past year. Of them, around 1,035 cases have been documented in the five districts.Ranchi has recorded 264 new cases, while Dhanbad has witnessed 114. East Singbhum district, including Jamshedpur, has recorded 188 new cases. Giridih has recorded 125 new HIV cases while Palamu has 132. However, Hazaribag has the most number of cases with 344 new infections in 2015. The survey is based on the screening of at least 1.07 lakh people, including priority groups such as sex workers, truck drivers and migrant workers, JSACS said.Dr Shami Akhtar, state programme officer for intervention in JSACS, said the number of new cases have recorded a marginal fall (0.02%) from 2014-15. During 2014-15, 1,645 new HIV infections were reported statewide. While Ranchi recorded 315 new infections during that period, Hazaribag remained the most affected with 463 positive cases out of 17,000 people screened.While the body attributed most of the new infections to migrant workers who were screened on their return home during festivals, JSACS suspects a larger number of unidentified HIV patients. ""The numbers can be anywhere between 30,000 to 36, 000 people,"" Akhtar said.

Although HIV epidemic in the country is slowing down with a 19% decline in new HIV infections (130,000 in 2013) and a 38% decline in AIDS-related deaths between 2005 and 2013, the proportion of people who do not have access to antiretroviral therapy treatment is still very high at around 64%.Agreeing to hear a PIL for setting up hospitals exclusively for treatment of HIV-infected patients in every district, a bench of Justices J S Khehar and C Nagappan issued notice to Centre seeking its response.The court passed the order on a petition filed by senior advocate Paramananda Katara who contended that every HIV- infected patient must be provided antiretroviral therapy at affordable price immediately after the diagnosis to stop the deadly virus from multiplying.

She set up a number of AIDS prevention education information centres and funded the education of 50 little boys from disadvantaged sections of the society from Sanguem.At the ongoing HIV Congress in the capital city, Du Boisrouvray was conferred with the meritorious service award for her invaluable contribution for the care and support of people living with HIV/AIDS.

We have the corporate team for emerging markets in India that determines which are the new countries we want to expand to, what are the strategies we need to adopt and so on. Today, Mylan’s manufacturing platform includes more than 40 facilities, 25 of which are located in India. Those include all nine of our API facilities, eight of our OSD (oral solid doses) facilities, and eight of our injectable facilities, which manufacture our high quality medicines for markets all over the world, including emerging markets.Absolutely.

In fact, Mylan is India’s third largest pharmaceutical exporter. Some think developing generic drugs involves zero or little R&D. But that’s far from the truth.We were second to enter the US in the marketing of a generic version of AstraZeneca’s heartburn drug Nexium, but we still managed to build a market share of 35-40% (the first mover typically has a huge advantage).

India respects the basic molecule and it’s a fair play as you need generics to reach millions of people.A lot of work is going on in the field of oncology, diabetes and Hepatitis C.

Today even a 90-year-old can contract the virus.""The audience fell silent for a moment before breaking into applause.Despite the efforts of activists like Pokrovsky, the total number of registered HIV cases in Russia exceeded one million in late 2015, with authorities struggling to contain an epidemic that experts say could be curbed by increased funding and more awareness campaigns.Pokrovsky has been openly critical of the Kremlin's policies promoting traditional family values, saying they have failed to halt the spread of the deadly virus.""In 2015 alone, some 100,000 new HIV cases were reported in Russia,"" Pokrovsky told AFP.""This is a very high rate, maybe the highest in Europe.""The Russian government's policy focuses on treatment while neglecting prevention drives such as sex education in schools, with the number of people infected with the virus soaring as a result, say experts.A public health campaign in Moscow last year urged people to be faithful to their partners, rather than promoting condom use.""Young people here often don't even know what HIV is and don't understand its dangers,"" said Moscow-based student Darya Belimova who joined Pokrovsky to address more than a thousand young people at the conference.The gathering was part of the ""Stop HIV/AIDS"" prevention campaign spanning more than 200 universities.Although the Russian health and education ministries support ""Stop HIV/AIDS"", activists and volunteers say they are fighting a lonely battle against Russia's AIDS epidemic as the virus increasingly affects the heterosexual population.The World Health Organization last year said that Russia accounted for 60 percent of all HIV diagnoses in Europe in 2014, with heterosexual sex the main route of transmission of the virus which is spread through contact with contaminated body fluids.The number of HIV-positive minors which stood at 9,792 in 2015 has also jumped 8.5 percent compared to the previous year.In most of these cases an HIV-positive mother transmitted the virus to the child at birth, said Pokrovsky.""In Russia, there is not enough public financing to support the fight against HIV at a national scale, and HIV prevention programmes for drug addicts practically don't exist,"" he said.There are just a few dozen NGOs working to fight the epidemic, spread across 40 Russian cities.""For Russia, this is a very small number,"" Pokrovsky said.Organizations like the Andrey Rylkov Foundation which runs an outreach programme for drug users in Moscow, handing out clean needles and condoms receive no government funding.The vast size of the country also presents a challenge for effective prevention, with far-flung corners of the federation like Siberia particularly badly affected.Russia also bans methadone replacement therapy for drug addicts, which would allow users to avoid injections, eliminating the risk of contracting the virus from contaminated syringes.Many Russian NGOs, including those working on HIV prevention among drug addicts, have been under increased pressure since the reelection of President Vladimir Putin to a third term in 2012.Shortly after he was sworn in once again, the government passed a law allowing authorities to brand groups engaging in broadly-defined ""political activity"" that receive foreign funding as ""foreign agents"".The legislation was passed soon after huge anti-Putin protests rocked Moscow, and Kremlin critics see the law as a way to muzzle the strongman's critics and tighten his grip on power.In April, a court ordered that Sotsium, an HIV prevention NGO based in the southwestern city of Saratov, be labelled ""foreign agents"" after it received 1.5 million rubles ($22,400) in foreign funding to conduct a survey among drug addicts and people with HIV.""Until recently, society wasn't really aware of the magnitude of the problem,"" said Sergei Smirnov, vice-chair of the Foundation for Social and Cultural Initiatives, the organization behind the ""Stop HIV/AIDS"" campaign.If the growth of HIV infections remains steady until 2021, Russia will face a so-called ""generalized epidemic,"" the foundation warns.An epidemic becomes ""generalized"" when HIV prevalence exceeds one percent in pregnant women nationwide, Pokrovsky said.""This rate now stands at 0.8 percent,"" he said.

The finding assumes significance as most blood banks, hospitals and transfusion centres use ELISA as a gold standard to detect HIV. The virus in the two city women could finally be detected using the PCR test that is occasionally used to test HIV. The Parel-based National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health (NIRRH) had come across the cases in 2012, when the women were referred from JJ Hospital with a history of co-infection.The revelation comes within days of the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) stating that 2,234 people have contracted HIV across the country through transfusion of infected blood in the past one-and-a-half years. In Maharashtra, 276 people have got HIV through infected blood.The point here is not to say that ELISA is unreliable but that there is a possibility of missing out infected bility of missing out infected cases. In both cases, the antibodies did not appear for two years,“ said Dr Atmaram Bandivadekar, consultant at NIRRH. HIV antibodies are generated by the body's immune system when under attack from the virus. Tests like ELISA check for the presence of antibodies to say if a person is infected or not.“Different individuals can take varying time to generate antibodies, but two years is too long,“ he said. Bandivadekar said that PCR could be a more accurate alternative. “This test finds either the RNA of the HIV virus or the HIV DNA in cells infected with the virus. The test can be done within days of exposure as one does not have to worry about the window period,“ he added. In an ELISA test, there is a window period of one to three months depending on whether the technology is from the first or fourth generation.The husbands of both these women were HIV positive and were taking the antiretro viral therapy at JJ Hospital.Doctors at the hospital became curious when the women frequently came with some ailment despite repeatedly testing negative for HIV .They stopped following up with the institute after two years.But staunch ELISA supporters are not willing to write off the test yet. “It has been proved beyond doubt that this test has a low chance of giving a false result after the first few weeks that a person is infected.The world over, it is the first line of screening. If ELISA is negative, other tests are not usually repeated,“ said a microbiologist. Though if ELISA comes positive, the test is repeated to confirm the findings.“PCR may be reliable but it is expensive and needs expertise,“ the doctor added.Bandivadekar felt all blood banks should have the PCR technology. Dr Shrikala Acharya, additional project director of the Mumbai District Aids Control Society ( MDACS ), said there are cost and operational issues that have to be considered. An ELISA test in a private lab costs up to Rs 650, whereas a PCR test may cost over Rs 2,500.","['test', 'elisa', 'accurate', 'infected', 'virus', 'pcr', 'consultant', 'women', 'blood', 'antibodies', 'nirrh', 'cases', 'hiv']","The virus in the two city women could finally be detected using the PCR test that is occasionally used to test HIV.

The country went from 100,000 HIV cases in 1990 to more than a million three years later, fuelled in part by its huge sex trade.Health workers initially struggled to persuade governments to act.But an eventual push to distribute free condoms among sex workers throughout the late 1990s and the widespread rollout of antiretroviral drugs in the 2000s has seen huge success and won the country widespread praise.""Thailand's progress shows how much can be achieved when science and medicine are underpinned by sustained political commitment,"" UNAIDS Executive Director Michel Sidibe said in a statement.But there is still work to be done. The UN estimates there are some 500,000 living with HIV in the kingdom, while infection rates have risen slightly in recent years, particularly among gay men.Piyasakol Sakolsatayadorn, Thailand's Minister of Public Health, said the landmark announcement ""belongs to everyone"" but added ""a challenge remains: how we make this success sustainable.""Each year, 1.4 million women living with HIV around the world become pregnant.

She went through the mandatory blood tests before surgery and everything was fine barring a low haemoglobin level. A blood transfusion done at the hospital to improve her platelet count, however, changed the course of her life for the worse.Though she was not operated upon in that period, she was given one unit of blood and asked to come back in five days by which time the Hb percentage was expected to improve. What followed came as a total shock. Subsequently, when Gowri came back for admission and after another round of blood tests, the results said: Reactive to HIV 1. And the interpretation was screaming: ""The above sample was repeatedly reactive for HIV I and II antibodies by three different test methods and therefore positive for HIV as per NACO guidelines.""The family was caught unawares. Not even a week prior to this second blood test, her sample showed HIV negative, in the same laboratory, of the same hospital. The hospital, which denied the allegations, reportedly told the family that Gowri was already infected before she came to them.It's been two years since her diagnosis and Gowri is on medication; her family has approached the Karnataka Medical Council and is fighting a case in the magistrate's court. The issue was brought before the state health department, and a committee was formed, but it did not see any action. A petition moved by V S Ugrappa, chairman of the expert committee on preventing sexual violence against women and children, has set the ball rolling with the police taking up the case.The complaint was filed recently at Sadashivnagar police station against the hospital, a gynaecologist, and two employees of the Integrated Counselling and Testing Center for cognisable offence of ""forgery with medical records and medical negligence"".""It is submitted that the accused hospital is involved in gross medical negligence by causing HIV infection via contaminated blood transfusion. Thereafter, the accused have tampered with the medical records to cover up the crime. The chain of events shows that within all human probability, the offence of forgery of medical records to conceal evidence of medical negligence. This complaint may be specially taken in record and speedily acted upon, because of the gravity of the crime, the maneuvers of the other side to hush up matters and cause great harm to me and my family,'' the complaint has stated.The major offences recorded are: Forgery of medical record (IPC section 466); cheating (420); forgery (463), making a false document (464). Subsequently, the police have taken up an FIR and investigations are on -- they are examining the medical records and have questioned the hospital staff and the doctor.Documents show that on February 13, 2014, Gowri was admitted to the hospital and discharged on the 15th. Her discharge summary says that her Hb% is 7.5m, platelet count 2.29; VDRL, HIV I & II negative and one unit of blood transfusion was advised. Accordingly, on the 14th, one unit (300 ml of RBC) was given (blood unit number 17093 for which the family has the record) and on the 15th she was discharged and asked to come back on the 19th.Subsequently, on February 19, Gowri was again admitted and the same set of blood tests were carried out. And this time the results were: Hb% 10.2, platelet count 2.23 and HIV I & II negative (in fact it is very unclear and looks like a scribble). The discharge summary read: ""Patient came with the above mentioned complaints, diagnosed to be Retro Positive and counseling done. Hence discharged on February 22.'' Surprisingly, the blood unit number was changed to 12093 in the hospital records.The patient gave another sample for testing at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Center on February 24 which also showed her positive for HIV. Intriguingly, the same Center has another record to show that on February 12, Gowri's sample was tested and came back HIV positive. But the catch is that Gowri was admitted to MS Ramaiah only on February 13, hence where did this blood test come from. The family sees something amiss.""This is a fraudulent document. When my sister was admitted on 13th and her blood sample drawn for testing at MS Ramaiah, why would she go for blood tests on the 12th? This document was created subsequently to show that the patient was infected before she was admitted. But the hospital's first discharge summary says that the blood tests are negative for HIV. This has to be investigated thoroughly,'' said the patient's husband Rajanna (name changed).MS Ramaiah Hospital termed the issue an ""allegation"" and its chief administrator Dr V Narendranath, who did not want to divulge much on the case, said, ""It is in court and it is sub judice. We will respond to the court and give a reply to the appropriate authority. We respect our patients and we cannot divulge the patient's medical history. We will not breach the patient's confidentiality at any cost."" Expressing his resentment over the police ""harassing the doctors and para-medical staff for four days"", Dr Narendranath says: ""Why is this a criminal case? These days, hospitals have become a soft target. Every patient has a right to express his/her grievance and somebody has to decide what is right and what is wrong.""For a start, MS Ramaiah Hospital doesn't come under the state government's Individual Donor Nucleic Acid Testing (ID-NAT) project where blood is tested at the highest standard. The normal process followed for testing of donated blood in private blood banks in hospitals is the Elisa test, which detects Hepatitis B and C and HIV for antigens and antibodies. However, under ID-NAT, the blood sample is tested for HIV, HBV (Hepatitis B) and HCV (Hepatitis C) to detect direct Ribo Nucleic Acid and DNA of the virus. All government hospital bloodbanks and Rotary-TTK are a part of this project where donated blood is mandatorily tested by ID-NAT. This test is done at Bowring Hospital, the only certified blood testing facility.According to specialists, a virus, after entering the bloodstream, has a window period and only after that can the antigens or antibodies be detected. HIV has a lower window period than HBV or HCV -- around 15-20 days. In case an HIV-infected person donates blood and the window period is just four to five days, the virus will go undetected and there is a fair chance that it could infect the person undergoing the blood transfusion.","['medical', 'hivve', 'testing', 'alleges', 'sample', 'admitted', 'unit', 'city', 'family', 'blood', '40yrold', 'hospital', 'gowri', 'hiv']","Subsequently, when Gowri came back for admission and after another round of blood tests, the results said: Reactive to HIV 1.

The patient, a 45-year-old man from northeast, has been living with HIV since 2003. He contracted Hepatitis C leading to liver failure.The family of the patient said the local hospitals they approached had given up, saying there was no cure for this complex condition. So, they rushed him to Delhi where the transplant was carried out.“It took us over 10 hours to carry out the life-saving procedure. We had to be very careful not to catch the infection. At the same time, we had to ensure that the patient didn’t contract any infection post transplant,” said Dr Naimish Mehta, senior liver transplant surgeon at SGRH.He said HIV patients are generally not taken up for major surgeries, particularly transplants, because they are immune-compromised.“In this case, for example, the patient had both HIV and Hepatitis C, which compromised his immunity significantly. Additionally, we had to suppress his immune system post transplant to ensure that the body doesn’t reject the new liver,” Mehta said.The liver transplant surgeon added that this was a huge challenge for them and any misstep could have proved fatal.The liver transplant surgeon said both the donor and the recipient were doing well.In India, 2.1 million people are living with HIV and Hepatitis C virus co-infection, said Dr Anil Arora, chairman, department of gastroenterology at the hospital.He added that initially HIV infection was considered an absolute contraindication for organ transplants because of concerns about disease progression.However, with recent advances in retro-viral therapy for HIV and treatment for Hepatitis C virus infection, complex procedures, including transplants, can be carried out, the doctor added.The US Congress recently passed HIV Organ Policy Equity Act (HOPE Act), which allows organ donation between HIV positive individuals.“The prevalence of liver disease in patients with HIV is higher than that of the general population, as are the morbidity and mortality. But with successful transplant, it is possible to give them a new life,” Arora added.According to the doctor, in India, the biggest hurdle for patients suffering from HIV is the stigma associated with this disease.In many areas, HIV positive people are considered social outcasts. Worse, they are turned away by many hospitals too. “In spite of medical advances, these patients find themselves condemned for life,” said another senior doctor at Gangaram hospital.","['transplants', 'infection', 'c', 'liver', 'patients', 'transplant', 'city', 'man', 'patient', 'surgeon', 'docs', 'hepatitis', 'hiv']","New Delhi: In a rare surgery, doctors at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital recently performed a liver transplant on an HIV positive person.

Introducing Hepatitis, a viral infection that affects the liver and is a leading cause of death and disability across the world. The disease is backed by some startling facts. A recent study published in The Lancet journal stated that viral hepatitis deaths increased by 63 per cent in the last 23 years.For the uninitiated, there are five different types of viral hepatitis, namely A, B, C, D and E. All of them are contagious and some are life threatening too. Hepatitis A and E are waterborne; Hepatitis B, C and D are transmitted by bodily fluids (via syringes, needles, injections, toothbrush, razors). Furthermore, all of them are contagious and some are life threatening too.Dr. Ajay P Choksi, Consultant and Head, Dept. of Gastroenterology & Hepatology at Nanavati Super Speciality Hospital, Mumbai explains, ""Hepatitis A and E are generally self limiting and don't normally last beyond six months. However, they can be severe, incapacitating and fatal during this period. Hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HBC), on the other hand, can give rise to acute illnesses like A (HBA) and E (HBE) but can also cause chronic liver disease, which can lead to cirrhosis of liver or even cancer of liver. Hepatitis D (HBD) infection occurs only if a person has Hepatitis B.""Shockingly, there have been a surge in deaths in the past 20 years. ""Despite alarming statistics, we as a country have not undertaken enough clinical research. Of the five, there is no cure for three of them. Hepatitis C alone affects estimated 12 million people in India, most of whom don't even know they are carriers. The combined burden of viral hepatitis is huge in India. We need treatment regimens that are short and therapies that are effective, affordable and well-tolerated,"" shares Suneela Thatte, President, Indian Society of Clinical Research (ISCR). World Health Organisation has stated that a shocking 95 per cent of people infected with Hepatitis B or C do not even know they are infected and often live without symptoms for a long time. This year alone, 10 to 30 million people will be infected with HBV. Dr Harshwardhan Dongre, K J Somaiya Hospital warns, ""Currently there is no treatment for acute Hepatitis B infection. Progression to chronic disease depends on a host of factors, so preventing acute infection is the only preventive measure available."" Dr. PM Bhujang – President, Association of Hospitals adds, ""Acute infection may present as fever, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting fever, abdominal pain, jaundice and dark urine. Chronic hepatitis may present with early and late symptoms of liver dysfunction and failure.""Unlike Hepatitis B, C and D, Hepatitis A and E do not damage the liver in the long term. ""Once infected or vaccinated, we do not get the infection again,"" adds Dr Vasudevan K R, senior consultant, surgical gastroenterology and liver transplantation department, Jaypee Hospital, Noida.Most of the viral hepatitis have vaccinations and so the first plan should be to get yourself duly immunized against them. Follow the below guidelines:- Avoid sharing sharp objects for example, needles, razor and toothbrush.- Avoid unprotected sex.- Three dosages of hepatitis B vaccine given at intervals of 0-1-6 months would give immunity against Hepatitis B at more than 95% probability.- All infants should be immunised against hepatitis B in 1st year of life.- All pregnant ladies should be screened for hepatitis B & C and if found positive, adequate measures should be taken to prevent transmission.- No open wound should be contacted without gloves.Dr. Neeraj Saraf, Associate Director - Hepatology, Medanta - The Medicity lays busts some common mythsNinety percent of infected adults with acute hepatitis B can recover without any problems, but most infected babies and children eventually develop chronic hepatitis B infection, where recovery is not possible. New antiviral treatments may reduce the incidence of complications by suppressing the virus and preventing progression of the disease.The Viral Hepatitis B vaccine is absolutely safe and extremely effective.

“The first step would be to transition from disposable to single use auto-disable syringes in the immunization programme so that any likelihood of syringe reuse is ruled out,” Saunik said on the sidelines of a WHO event on Hepatitis Day on Thursday. “It will be complemented by extensive awareness about birth vaccination, training of healthcare workers on handling and maintenance of drugs and safe disposal of syringes. Timing of the vaccination is also of utmost importance.”

Unsafe injection practices such as reuse of syringes and needles is a leading cause of transmission of blood-borne pathogens such as hepatitis B, C and HIV. Transfusion of unsafe blood is another route through which these infect people. It is estimated that over 1.15lakh people die of hepatitis B related complications every year in the country.","['injection', 'norms', 'syringes', 'practices', 'ushers', 'fight', 'b', 'safe', 'vaccination', 'saunik', 'state', 'unsafe', 'hepatitis', 'hiv']","The state has become one of the first in the country to adopt safe injection practices with an aim to check the spread of HIV, hepatitis B and C infections, which are often transmitted by the use of unsafe syringes or absence of injection protocols in healthcare settings.

Although male sex workers (MSWs) come under the high-risk category under HIV intervention programmes, their names rarely make it to the list. The result is more than 25 years after the initiation of the country's AIDS control programme, most of them continue to engage in unsafe sex. study by a group of researchers from institutes across the world, including the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis (NIRT), Chennai, has found that 74.2% of the MSWs they surveyed accepted more money from their clients to not use a condom. The study, recently published in AIDS Care, took into account experiences of 100 male sex workers around the age of 25 years in the city. Beena Thomas, an NIRT scientist, who was part of the research, said at least three-fourth of the subjects surveyed expressed difficulty in convincing their clients to use condoms. “They find it hard to negotiate. And if sex work is their only source of income, it is likely that they agree to go forward without protection as the clients pay more,“ she said. The subjects said they earned between `2,000 and `8,000 a month.Although male sex workers are at a higher risk of contracting HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STI), they remain understudied compared to their female peers. Experts attribute this to the stigma attached not just to sex work, but their sexual orientation as well.The study also noted that only 64% of them reported ever testing for HIV. Dr Sundar Sundararaman, a physician who has worked with HIV patients for the past 30 years, isn't surprised by these figures. He said while HIV intervention programmes have listed transgender, women sex workers and homosexual men under the high-risk category, they are yet to recognize male sex workers as an exclusive group. “Male sex workers are not identified and so they aren't in the ambit of service delivery ,“ he said, advocating changes at the policy level. He said financial incentives for riskier sexual behaviour, coupled with lack of access to prevention services, increased prevalence of HIV and STIs among MSWs compared to broader population of men having sex with men. The study also noted that more than half of the subjects did not know the HIV status of their most recent client.As believed, it is not just women sex workers who face abuse. Researchers found 60% of the MSWs faced verbal abuse and 40% were physically assaulted. Those who financially depended only on sex work were far more vulnerable and likely to report abuse.Dr Vijaya Raman of Tamil Nadu AIDS Initiative said the numbers were alarming and urgent steps needed to be taken for intervention programmes to reach this group. “Our outreach programmes need to be revamped. This is an evolving sector. Previously , they operated in groups, now many of them work individually through the internet, which gives them anonymity,“ he said.The study threw another surprise highlighting the need to identify this group -nearly 72% said they wanted to continue sex work. “This being the case, HIV prevention interventions shouldn't try to draw MSWs away but focus on facilitating skills that will support their ability to negotiate sexual safety,“ said Thomas.","['workers', 'hiv', 'msws', 'subjects', 'chennai', 'programmes', 'work', '74', 'male', 'sex', 'group', 'risk', 'study']","Although male sex workers (MSWs) come under the high-risk category under HIV intervention programmes, their names rarely make it to the list.

To make sure you don't miss any, here is this week's aggregation of the latest news stories on health, fitness and diet. Hepatitis: Everything you need to know in 3 minutes or less One of the main challenges to addressing hepatitis is that 95 per cent of people with chronic hepatitis do not know they are infected and less than one per cent have access to treatment, states WHO.At present, cases being treated at public hospitals are only taken into account to assess the disease burden. Putting every case on record is a crucial challenge in eliminating malaria which the country aims to achieve by 2030.Curcumin is the active ingredient in the spice turmeric, which is present in spicy curry dishes, and silymarin is a component of milk thistle, which has been used to treat liver disease.""India has witnessed a 20% rise in allergies in the past five years, and the spike can be a direct fallout of our changing lifestyle that takes us away from trees and farmland.Brazilian scientists have identified another type of Zika-transmitting mosquito, responsible for over 1,700 cases of microcephaly in newborns in the South American country since October 2015.Health may soon be declared a fundamental right of every individual, similar to education, if the draft National Health Policy proposed by the ministry goes through.""At least 70% common gastroenterological infections may be associated with eating out. When we ask patients about what they ate last, the most common answer is non-vegetarian food at an eating joint""Over the past one year, around 123 samples of fish were taken and analyzed at the Central Institute of Fisheries Technology (CIFT), which is a nationally-accredited agency by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) for testing the quality of fish.Despite high economic growth in recent years, India has more stunted children than Nigeria, Pakistan, China and the Republic of Congo combined.For the uninitiated, there are five different types of viral hepatitis, namely A, B, C, D and E. All of them are contagious and some are life threatening too.Recently, a 26-year-old techie was referred to Manipal Hospitals after a master check-up elsewhere showed his liver enzymes were alarmingly high. Blood test revealed the youth was suffering from Hepatitis C infection.Scientists in Germany have discovered a bacteria hiding out in peoples' noses that produces an antibiotic compound that can kill several dangerous pathogens, including the superbug MRSA.This is placing a huge disease, social and economic burden on the affected families as well as the health system, the UN agency said.Responding to work emails after work hours may seem like an increase in productivity, but it turns out, it is negatively impacting employee well-being.Excessive consumption of alcohol can lead to seven forms of cancer, and individuals consuming even low to moderate amounts are at risk, says a review.A study done by scientists from Ethopia and Sweden has claimed that mosquitoes are repelled by the smell of chickens.The suggestion stems from a study in which the scientists discovered the first in vivo evidence that strains of chimpanzee-carried simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) that virologists consider the ancestor of HIV can infect human cells.Researchers have found that combinations of three different antibiotics can help overcome bacteria's resistance to antibiotics, even when none of the three antibiotics on their own, or even two of the three together, is effective.Researchers have identified a panel of genes which can help predict whether a transplanted kidney will later develop fibrosis -- a condition which can cause the organ to fail.Researchers from Louisiana State University in the US, discovered and patented the compounds known as LAU that prevented the seizures and their damaging effects on dendritic spines in an experimental model of epilepsy in mice.If successful, it's hoped that the advance could stop it at the origin of the disease.To better treat a variety of diseases, researchers have developed soft, flexible and motor-less microrobots that can be remotely controlled with electromagnetic fields.In a worst-case scenario, an estimated 3 to 37 of the thousands of athletes, spectators, media and vendors traveling to Rio for the Olympics will bring the Zika virus back to their home countries, the researchers at Yale School of Public Health (YSPH) concluded.As many as 93 million people in Latin America and the Caribbean, including 1.6 million childbearing women, are at risk of catching the Zika virus before the epidemic burns out, according to a team of researchers.Researchers at North Dakota State University, Fargo, found that 51 percent of labels on e-cigarette liquid nicotine containers from 16 North Dakota stores don't accurately reflect the levels of nicotine found in the products.A 17-year-old girl from Jaffrabad, northeast Delhi, died at Lok Nayak hospital on July 21 after suffering from high fever, abdominal pain and vomiting - dengue symptoms.Laxative-induced constipation, experts say, is a new health concern and its spread may spiral out of control if not tackled.The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared Brazil free of measles, after no case of the disease was registered in the last year.Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) may offer a practical, low-cost alternative to other tests.Despite the cost of drugs coming down and dramatic advances in the treatment of Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C, getting rid of both types of the disease remains a huge challenge primarily due to lack of awareness and unsafe injection practices.Stopping use of tobacco and adopting a healthy lifestyle can prevent almost 80 per cent of head and neck cancer cases in India, say doctors.","['health', 'seven', 'india', 'cancers', 'high', 'weekly', 'right', 'virus', 'deadlier', 'fundamental', 'cent', 'disease', 'roundup', 'discovered', 'scientists', 'hepatitis', 'cases', 'hiv']","Dirty water stunts millions of Indian children.

The numbers, though based on voluntary disclosure of clients visiting HIV testing centres, have raised serious concerns about safety and testing protocols at blood banks in the city.The RTI response by the Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) shows that 18 got HIV through infected blood in 2015-16. The infections more than doubled (42) in 2014-15. In 2013-14, 25 infections were attributed to blood transfusion.The disclosure came as the National Aids Control Organization (NACO) claimed that transfusion-transmitted infections are largely restricted to rural areas with limited medical infrastructure.Government agencies fighting HIV in the city are clueless about the source of the untested blood. “We were told there is no mechanism to trace the source of the infected blood or find out which bank supplied it.It is a worrying situation,“ said Chetan Kothari, who filed the RTI. The numbers were collated from integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC) at all major public hospitals of the city. MDACS said only a miniscule percentage of HIV cases in the city are caused by infected blood. “The heterosexual route is still responsible for more than 90% infections. Out of the 8,000odd cases detected in the city annually, only 0.02% is attributable to blood transfusion,“ said Dr Shrikala Acharya, additional project director, MDACS.Activists, however, felt blood banks have a major role to play. “As per rules, when a donor turns out to be HIV positive, heshe must be informed and referred to the centres. But most blood banks don't do it,“ said an employee of a leading blood bank who has been advocating safe blood. He insisted the blood donor, unaware of his status, continues to donate blood. “If he is within the 3-6month window, the ELISA test used to check blood in most banks won't be able to detect the virus,“ he said.Therefore, a huge emphasis should be on pre-donor counselling. “A detailed history of the donor before blood donation, where they are asked open questions about their lifestyles, can significantly bring down infection. But, unfortunately, at most blood camps, it is looked at as a waste of time,“ said Dr Zarine Bharucha, chairperson, Federation of Bombay Blood Banks (FBBB).Dearth of infrastructure and manpower at blood banks are additional challenges. A pathologist told TOI there is a staff shortage at most banks. “Blood is not tested for days or there is shortage of kits. This can lead to false negativity or positivity,“ the doctor said.","['testing', 'turn', 'donor', 'infected', 'control', 'city', 'rti', 'banks', 'blood', '85', 'infections', 'transfusion', 'hiv']","Mumbai's AIDS control body, in an RTI, has revealed that 85 people were infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) while getting blood transfusion in the last three years.

But precious time was lost and it was all too late. The woman delivered a stillborn at the Bareilly district hospital here. Doctors said the infant could have been saved had the mother received immediate medical attention. An inquiry has been ordered into the incident.What has added to poignancy of their situation is the fact that both the husband and wife have physical disabilities. Shyam and Reena (not their real names) had got married a year and half back. Shyam, who did odd jobs here and there, then took his new wife to Delhi in search of better opportunities, but Reena soon started falling ill frequently. “Doctors in Delhi informed us that Reena was infected with HIV. We could not afford medical expenses in the capital city and returned to Badaun,” said a teary-eyed Shyam.On Sunday afternoon, Reena was rushed to the district hospital in Badaun with severe labour pangs. But she was reportedly denied treatment by the hospital staff after learning that she was HIV positive.“I requested them repeatedly to treat my wife but they demanded Rs 2,000 to buy gloves for their protection and also asked me to arrange for blood. We were there the whole day and when her condition deteriorated at night, the hospital staff asked us to take her to Bareilly district hospital,” Shyam told TOI on Thursday. “We have lost our child and want the government to take strict action against the hospital staff in Badaun. I do not want other couples like us to suffer the same pain in future,” Shyam said.Chief medical superintendent (CMS) at women’s district hospital of Bareilly, Dr Alka Sharma said, “We immediately attended to the patient here but could not save the child. The woman had an obstructed labour and required an immediate surgery. Had they come to us earlier, the child could have been saved. The condition of the woman is stable now.” Chief medical officer (CMO) at Badaun, Dr Sunil Kumar, said he was aware of the allegations and had ordered a probe into the charges.

The NGO Saathi is working across the country to prevent newborn children from getting the virus from their mother. By roping in 50 private hospitals of the city, the NGO has prevented around 150 pregnant women from passing HIV to their foetus.The NGO presented a stall at the first ever two-day women health exhibition of the city ‘Stree Aarogyam’ organized, from Saturday, by the Nagpur Obstetrics and Gynaecology Society and Women’s wing of Indian Medical Association (IMA), at IMA House The National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), under the Prevention of Mother-To-Child Transmission (PMTCT) project is providing pregnant women a short-term therapy at district hospitals to prevent the virus gtom getting transmitted to the foetus. Across the country, Saathi has been supporting the initiative by tying up with private hospitals. As soon as the doctor at any hospital detects an HIV-positive pregnant woman, the NGO is called to counsel the women and connect her to the district hospital to get the treatment to prevent her child.Saathi’s local chapter started functioning from 2010. “Until now, we have prevented around 150 newborns from HIV infection,” said programme coordinator Pradeep Marchettiwar . In the absence of a district hospital, the city has three centres which offer treatment, including Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGMCH), Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) and the government hospital at Kamptee.During the exhibition, NOGS president Anuradha Ridhorkar said, “Most issues related to women’s health are correlated. At the clinic, it’s not possible for us to counsel every single patient. Through this exhibition, we have formed a common umbrella under which various issues related to women health can be discussed on spot between doctor and patient.”A stall conducted by gynaecologist Dr Kshama Kedar talked about mensuration and hygiene. “Using one sanitary napkin for long hours can cause an infection. But what many girls don’t know is that the same infection is the rising cause of female infertility,” she said. A lot of girls visiting the stalls were told about hygienic measures they should take during their periods. Other stalls were related to issues like HIV, hypertension, AIDS, anaemia, contraception and obesity.","['prevent', 'hivpositive', 'infection', 'lifesaver', 'issues', 'babies', 'pregnant', 'women', 'medical', 'related', 'hospital', 'ngo', 'mothers', 'hiv']","Nagpur: Transmission of HIV from a mother to child accounts for over 90% of new HIV infections among children.

While fear of dogs, lizards and mathematics are very common, city-based psychiatrists admit to coming across more extreme and sometimes weird cases. From homophobia to scare of having HIV , from worry over not having mobile connectivity to fear of being touched – a large number of Kolkatans are experiencing all of these and even more. Some are even tweaking around with their lifestyle to deal with their fear.A very common phobia that doctors have reported is the fear of having HIV. A small cut in a salon is enough to trigger it. Some of these patients don’t just live with the fear. They even go to the extent of getting HIV tests done. Sometimes, the tests are done repeatedly. Dissatisfied with repeated negative HIV tests, general physicians then refer them to psychiatrists. “They live with this fear despite having done the tests. Some also have similar phobia about having swine flu,” said psychiatrist Dr Jairanjan Ram.Psychiatrist Dr Abir Mukherjee has also come across this phobia. Mukherjee makes a distinction between obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and phobia. According to him persons with OCD experience persistent recurrent intrusive thoughts that might result in them avoiding imaginary situations. They might see a drop of blood on the floor and imagine that somehow they will have HIV from it. “In case of phobia, the person exercises caution in behaviour and might display a tendency to avoid real situations. He might not visit a parlour for fear of ‘contacting’ HIV,” Mukherjee explained, also mentioning cases of patients suffering from fear of mosquito bites and earthquakes.The increasing depending on mobile phones has led to the rise of nomophobia or the fear of no mobile connectivity because of network or battery charge issues. An investment banker from this city recently cut short his four-day vacation for river rafting because there was no mobile connectivity. Anil Punjabi, chairman (east) of the Travel Agents’ Federation of India, has noticed how this fear among tourists has had them change their travel plans. “Recently parents didn’t give permission to their children to go out camping to a place where there was no mobile connectivity.” Fear of not having WiFi has also gone up.Adding to this list is the pathological fear of contamination and germs or mysophobia. Psychologist Shibhika Singh came across a patient who just didn’t want to touch the doorknobs. “She would wait for someone to offer assistance to help her open the doors. She is undergoing cognitive behavioural therapy to overcome this,” she said.Fear of being touched or haphephobia is an issue with many teenagers. “This often occurs when a child has a history of sexual abuse. I remember a teenager who had turned violent. After some sessions, I found that his violent behaviour was his defence mechanism because he feared anyone touching him. So even a pat on his back was problematic. Later it was detected that as a child his parent would get violent with him and those memories had an impact on his behavioural patterns,” Singh said, adding that she has also come across cases of necrophobia or the fear of losing a dear one to death.Fear of taking flights is common among Kolkatans. Mukherjee recalls a top executive who had come for counselling because he just couldn’t go for air travel. He even missed out on promotions because he couldn’t go for overseas trip. After graded exposure and systematic desensitization, he was able to overcome the fear, fly overseas and get his promotion too. “Agoraphobia is also common,” said Mukherjee. It is an anxiety disorder characterized by symptoms of anxiety in situations where the person perceives the environment to be unsafe with no easy way to get away. “The problem can be so acute that they even fear to go anywhere alone,” Mukherjee added.Homophobia, psychiatrists insist, is also quite common. “Because of this fear, some have even approached me with strange requests to conduct tests to ascertain if they are bisexual or homosexual,” Ram said.But what is even more curious in this city is that many closet homosexuals also display this homophobia. Choreographer Sudarshan Chakraborty remembers one incident at a party where a much-married man was openly abusing homosexuals. “Much later, when I interacted with him on a one-on-one basis, he started flirting with me. Being macho in front of the world was his defence mechanism to announce that he isn’t gay,” Chakraborty said. According to Chakraborty, at least 60 per cent of gay men in Kolkata live dual lives and many among them are homophobes too in public.","['tests', 'phobias', 'kolkata', 'connectivity', 'mukherjee', 'fear', 'violent', 'mobile', 'common', 'phobia', 'having', 'hiv']","From homophobia to scare of having HIV , from worry over not having mobile connectivity to fear of being touched – a large number of Kolkatans are experiencing all of these and even more.

We are exploring the real possibility of curing HIV. This is a huge challenge and it's still early days but the progress has been remarkable.""The HIV virus is mostly transmitted by sex. Once in the body it targets T-cells, part of the immune system, splicing itself into their DNA. If the T-cell is active the HIV hijacks it, turning it into a tiny factory spewing millions more viruses to infect other T-cells.It is this aspect of HIV activity that is targeted and suppressed by anti-retroviral therapies (ART). What ART cannot do is pick out the millions of infected T-cells lying dormant around the body -- but waiting to spring into life should ART fail. It is the HIV reservoir in these dormant cells that the research group is targeting.""It would be great if a cure has happened.

However, that could be the anti-retroviral therapies, so we have to wait to be sure,"" the London-based patient said.The new trial is being backed by the UK's state-funded National Health Service (NHS) because it could save millions by removing the need to treat HIV patients with ART, which costs around 380,000 pounds per person over their lifetime.","['report', 'body', 'research', 'dormant', 'cure', 'virus', 'british', 'trial', 'verge', 'london', 'art', 'millions', 'treatment', 'scientists', 'hiv']","We are exploring the real possibility of curing HIV.

This puts them at greater risk of HIV The study, undertaken by a team from Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, covered 11,700 men who have sex with men (MSM) in 12 districts, including Chennai. It found that close to 23% of gender non-conforming boys were victimised by older trusted men, which pushed them to engage in HIV-risk behaviour later in life.Epidemiologist Sunil Solomon, who was part of the research, said when the team set out to study the burden of HIV among MSM, several participants they surveyed shared their sexual experiences as children. “What troubled us was that many of them described it as experience, not realizing they were survivors of abuse. They thought it was natural, which only further marginalized them,” said Solomon.A kothi (effeminate man) in Chennai recalled his uncle molesting him when he was three. “I didn't know what he was doing,” the study quoted him as saying. Later in life, he tested positive for HIV.“I didn't tell anyone what happened to me. When they (his family) scold me (for having HIV), I want to say `You should have taken care when I was young. I am alone now'.”According to official estimates, men who have sex with men have a 12-14 times higher prevalence of HIV than other men.The study found that the prevalence of child sexual abuse was higher among ""gender non-conforming men"" than the general population, which also increased their vulnerability to HIV.They found that those who had a history of abuse had approximately 2.5 times more lifetime male sexual partners compared to those without and the HIV prevalence was almost double in the former group.Child sexual abuse in general has been identified as an important predictor of high-risk sexual behaviour later in life for both men and women, including early sexual debut, unprotected sex, multiple partners, and engagement in transactional sex, which increases the risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.A study by UNICEF, covering 13 states, found that more than half of children (53%) reported abuse, with the prevalence being higher for boys than girls (53% and 23% respectively).The study found the prevalence of child sexual abuse among the group to be the highest in Tamil Nadu where 43.2% of the participants claimed they were sexually abused, with Coimbatore having the highest at 70.2%. In Chennai, 34.3% said they were abused. Experts say the prevalence is probably high in the south because of better reporting.Child rights and LGBT activists say the study has highlighted the need for more intervention programmes for boys who have been victims of abuse.“While abuse is generally high among children, the prevalence is exceptionally high among gender nonconforming boys.

According to a study by National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), between January 2015 and May 2016, 127 patients in the state contracted HIV due to inappropriate blood transfusion.Out of 184 licensed blood banks in the state, only 66 are NACO certified for safe blood. Going by the report, Uttar Pradesh tops the list with 371 HIV positive cases triggered through blood transfusion, followed by Gujarat (292), Maharashtra (276), New Delhi (264) and West Bengal (135).Officials at Indian Foundation for Safe Blood (IFSB), an organization that works towards creating awareness about diseases transmitted during blood transfusions, said: “Globally, 15 % of HIV is transmitted through blood transfusions and in India the rate is extremely alarming. In the past five years, 9,000 people in India got affected by HIV due to blood transfusion. In Chhattisgarh blood transfusion has become a major carrier of AIDS. In Jodhpur, 53 kids were tested positive for Hepatitis C after receiving infected blood. Although better than five other states, Karnataka still doesn’t look safe.” Blood transfused without proper checks could result in deadly infections like HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Malaria, Syphilis, Dengue and Chikungunya.Explaining the reasons behind random collection of blood, IFSB officials added: “Often, shortage of blood leads to unhealthy ways of collecting it. Another problem is non-availability of the exact blood group. Also, only a very small percentage of blood is collected through repeat voluntary blood donors, who are the safest donors. Most of the others are first-time donors who are more likely to transmit infections as they aren’t tested in advance. Further, majority of blood is collected through mass blood donation camps which lack proper facilities for screening.”Asked about ways to tackle the problem, another source from IFSB said, “The method of testing needs to improve. The Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) method should be used to detect HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. NAT is conducted in two ways --- Mini Pool Nucleic Acid Testing and Individual Donor Nucleic Acid Testing (ID NAT). In the first one, blood samples are pooled together for the purpose of testing. However, there’s a disadvantage. Even if one sample contains a virus, the entire batch has to be discarded and each sample tested individually all over again. ID NAT is the best method as it captures the virus itself. Increase in voluntary repeat blood donation, pre-donation health history screening and hemovigilance programme are other ways to address the issue.”ID NAT methodID NAT is a conventional method of testing blood. It requires the presence of antibodies to trigger a positive test result. ID NAT is used to detect the low levels of viral genetic material present in the body. However, it happens before the body begins producing antibodies in response to a virus, enabling detection of a disease early. This method significantly reduces the time between donor exposure to the virus and the appearance of antibodies. This way, it allows for earlier detection of the infection and thereby reduces the possibility of transmission via transfusion.Pvt hospitals to blameAccording to NACO data, of the 66 NACO-assisted blood banks in Karnataka, 40 are in the government sector and 26 are in NGOs, charitable and voluntary sector, without a single one in the private hospital sector. IFBS officials say Karnataka has already taken steps to curb transmission of infection through blood transfusion and that it’s the only state government in the country to have made ID NAT mandatory in all government blood banks and hospitals. However, this crucial blood safety technique hasn’t been widely adopted by private hospitals in the state.Other affected states.

However, their recent visit to a Bengaluru hospital turned things for the better.Sachin, now aged 10, is cured of thalassemia after he underwent the bone marrow transplant (BMT) five months ago and his six-year-old brother was the donor. Bone marrow transplant on a patient infected with HIV is ridden with risks and the procedure was a huge challenge for the 100-odd team of doctors and para-medical staff at the Majumdar Shaw Cancer Centre. This is, according to the doctor who treated Sachin, is the second successful case in the world and the first in India. The boy hasn’t shown symptoms of HIV for the past five months.“We were devastated to know he was contracted with the deadly virus. We approached many transplant centres, but none of them wanted to even touch him,” said Sachin’s father who finally decided to try his luck in Bengaluru.“When he came, the boy’s immune system was weak and infections were high. I realized that HIV infection could flare up during the transplant. That was the biggest challenge for us. The whole process, including preparing the boy for the surgery, took several weeks. The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) matched with his sibling, making the transplant possible,” Dr Sunil Bhat, senior consultant and head of paediatric haematology, oncology and bone marrow transplant at Mazumdar Shaw Cancer Centre, Narayana Health City.Sachin’s HIV infection is now under control and he no longer needs any blood transfusion, he added.It may be too early to predict, given that the transplant took place just five months ago. But if the boy doesn’t show further symptoms of HIV relapse in the next one year, this procedure can be considered as a possible cure for HIV. There’s no need to worry about HIV transmission between the bone marrow donor and the recipient; the donor is at no risk of contracting HIV in the process.

But if the boy doesn’t show further symptoms of HIV relapse in the next one year, this procedure can be considered as a possible cure for HIV.
There’s no need to worry about HIV transmission between the bone marrow donor and the recipient; the donor is at no risk of contracting HIV in the process.

The situation is no better in Karnataka, with only 21% of the HIV positive transgenders and 33% of the infected female sex workers undergoing anti-retroviral therapy, according to the Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS).Ahead of World AIDS Day on December 1 (Thursday), TOI found that of the 6,756 HIV-infected female sex workers in the state, only 2,257 are benefitting from anti-retroviral therapy. Similarly, of the 175 transgenders with HIV, only 37 are being treated. This despite the HIV Bill introduced in 2014 — it was amended this year — which makes anti-retroviral therapy (it can enhance longevity) a legal right for all HIV patients.“A recent study conducted by Swasti for the United Nations Development Programme revealed that often doctors refuse to treat individuals from the transgender community. They are either ignored or are shown the door by doctors, who say they don’t know how to treat them,” said Shama Karkal , director, Avahan – Swasti, a health resource centre that works with the transgender community, sex workers and gay men. The study covered transgenders in five states — Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, UP, Gujarat and Maharashtra.The study showed that even transgenders are hesitant about getting themselves tested for HIV, though hospitals provide the facility. “There is an assumption that only those who are sexually active or sexually promiscuous need to get the test done. Transgenders are judged not only by hospital staff but also their peers,” she added.Highlighting the distress of female sex workers, thoracic surgeon and director of SDS Tuberculosis Research Centre and Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases, Dr Shashidhar Buggi, said: “We cannot expect others to stop discriminating against sex workers if the doctor community itself is biased. The harsh reality is despite being aware of the nature of HIV virus, the medical fraternity often chooses not to treat an infected patient. The stigma is even more deep-rooted when the patient happens to be a sex worker.”Stating that numbers don’t depict the real picture, Dr Buggi explained: “The existence of prevention societies is not enough to bring about a positive change in the health condition of sex workers, as the ground reality is different from what’s there on paper. There is no proper retrieving system in place, with no one to assess the work of these organizations and question their accountability. Most of the cases these organizations record are under-reported.”Demonetization a hindranceThe recent demonetization policy has only added to the plight of transgenders as far as treatment is concerned. “It has become very difficult to meet medical and travel expenses. I recently had to undergo a uterus operation, which was an expensive procedure. The tests and follow-up visits have drilled a hole in my pocket and scrapping of the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has only made it worse,” said Usha, an HIV positive transgender.Manta, another transgender who’s a sex worker, said: “I am HIV positive but I have learnt to take care of my health. However, after demonetization, my income has drastically reduced. Either the clients don’t pay or they hand over high denomination notes. Either way, I am left with no money.”Social hierarchy a barrierAnother study on transgenders revealed that social hierarchical systems play a major role in deciding which healthcare services an individual can access. Every decision vests with the guru. The study found that 12.3% of the community members opted for informal surgeries conducted by someone from the community or the guru as opposed to formal services provided in hospitals.

The level of depression among adolescents and youth is so acute that some have lost their spirit of optimism.An official said HIV-positive youth and teenagers are more likely to lead a depressed life if they have no family support. Sadly, in the case of most of the youth, family ties are missing with one or both parents long dead. The majority are brought up in orphanages. A few are looked after by their extended families. Akash Naik , 23, who was raised in an orphanage since birth — his parents had left him in the hospital after his HIV status came to light — has grown so pessimistic that he refuses to believe that anything positive will happen in his life. The ART staff try to boost his morale by telling him about the research under way to invent new drugs to improve quality of life of persons living with HIV, but Akash’s hopes are long lost.“Akash doesn’t even want to consider a possibility that better drugs that can cure HIV will be invented. He is certain that HIV will not leave him till his death,” a counsellor said.Of the 7,000-odd persons registered with the ART Centre of the Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, maximum numbers are of those in the reproductive age group, a source said and added that most of them are depressed. Agnelo Lobo , 19, a class XII student, has failed to keep pace with studies. He went into depression after he started developing severe side effects of ART. “Due to the illness he has not been able to concentrate. His mother’s second marriage has further upset him. We have advised him to complete his education through correspondence courses,” the official said pointing out that having to lead life without family support increases the probability of depression.“Once they turn 18, they have nowhere to go. ART lengthens lives and improves quality of life. But, now, the bigger question before them is how to lead a normal life, and that, too, all alone,” he said and added that there has to be some backup plan to enable HIV-positive persons in the reproductive age group to lead a healthy life.For the last few months, Shivanand Azrekar, 25, has been going through bouts of depression. Azrekar is married and has one child and every time he visits the ART centre, the first question he asks the staff is, “how much time do I have?” Despite being put on ART, Azrekar’s condition is deteriorating, the official said.On a positive note, Goa has succeeded in bringing mother-to-child transmission to zero. Also, the ART centre has some help coming its way in treating depressed HIV-positive youth and teenagers.

The CD4 count is an indicator of how well the body's immune system is working.Globally, patient groups have been demanding that each and every HIV-positive person should be given free ART drugs by their governments.The WHO in 2015 had recommended that all HIV patients should be started on ART irrespective of their CD4 count. In India, out of 21 lakh people living with the disease, only 55% are currently on free ART.In Mumbai too, out of the 70,000-odd people living with the disease, a little over 35,000 are on the drug regimen.Eldred Tellis, one of the founding members of Mumbai Aids Forum , said the health ministry was looking away from a mammoth human crisis. “People who suffer from HIV are extremely vulnerable to opportunistic infections.But our systems are not geared to treat those infections,“ he said.

Though India now does not allow HIV self-test, the UN agency's guidance has even prompted the health ministry here to evaluate the proposal.“We will certainly look at WHO's recommendations and evaluate how it can be adopt ed,“ said C K Mishra, secretary to the health ministry.The move assumes significance as the lack of HIV diagnosis is a major obstacle to reducing the burden of the infection worldwide because it hinders the government and public health agency to offer anti-retroviral therapy or other treatment options to those suffering from the disease.Estimates show around 87% of HIV-infected people in India are not even aware that they are suffering from the disease and may be unknowingly spreading the virus. Globally , around 40% of all people with HIV or over 14 million remain unaware of their status.Self-testing will be particularly relevant for those people who may find it difficult to access testing in clinical settings and might prefer self-testing as their method of choice.HIV self-test can be done by individuals by using oral fluid or blood-finger-pricks to discover their status in a private and convenient setting. Results of the test can be seen within 20 minutes or less.Those with positive results are advised to seek confirmatory tests at health clinics. WHO recommends they receive information and links to counselling as well as rapid referral to prevention, treatment and care services.

It shows how fit a person’s natural defence system is to fight pathogens, infections and illnesses. While the CD4 count of a healthy person is anything between 500 and 1,500, the count of an HIV-infected person tends to drop below the normal.Since the launch of the National HIV AIDS Control programme in India, it has been the basis for starting ART treatment. Earlier, a person with CD4 of 250 or less was put on ART medicines. This was later revised to 350 to benefit more patients.Those with CD4 count above the range were considered ‘healthy’ and had to wait for their condition to deteriorate for the treatment to start. However, HIV-positive pregnant women, children, people with TB or history of TB or hepatitis B, C and discordant couples were excluded.In 2013, WHO called for a revision of the benchmark and pressed for starting ART even if CD4 count was around the normal range of 500. “It based the move on a number of sub-Saharan, South American and American studies which showed better survival and quality of life if ART was started at CD4 count of 500,” he explained.WHO document on the issue cites a number of advantages of early medication, one of them being that CD4 count remains in the normal range.Experts said UP was a low prevalence but high vulnerability state.

The sole NGO, which is currently working with the MSM (men who have sex with men) population, is involved in a number of programmes, but others say not enough is being done to cover a large migrant population in the city that is potential risk for people in other states.According to Srikant of Society For Service To Voluntary Agencies (SOSVA), the only active NGO currently working among the MSM population, there is a large migrant population and female sex workers who are currently not made aware of HIV/AIDS at the ground level. “The migrant population changes every six to seven months, so there is a constant requirement to raise awareness among them. The risk of HIV is not only limited to them, but also extends to their wives and families when they go back home,” Srikant says.Gurgaon has already recorded 158 cases of HIV till the end of October 2016.

Notably, children under 15 years of age accounted for 6.54 per cent of the total HIV infected population in India, a bulk of them having been transmitted the disease from their parents at birth. Eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV-AIDS is the next major challenge for India, the risk of which can be successfully minimised or even eliminated with effective and sustained use of medication,” said Dr P Haranath, dermatologist from Bhavya Skin Care Centre, Vizag.As per NACO Technical Estimate Report (2015), out of an estimated 29 million annual pregnancies in India, about 35,255 occur in HIV positive pregnant women. This data postulates that in the absence of any intervention, over 10,000 babies infected with HIV are being born every year. According to World Health Organization , without any intervention, transmission rates range from 15 per cent to 45 per cent.“Putting infected expectant mothers on anti-retroviral therapy as soon as pregnancy is discovered is an essential intervention. At birth, the baby is also put on a brief six-week therapy to combat the threat. This protocol can successfully prevent mother-to-child transmission in most cases,” he said.Relentless awareness campaigns and successful use of anti-retroviral therapy has helped India reduce the burden of HIV/AIDS prevalence steadily over the past two decades.

The leak, which underscores the vulnerability of electronic medical records, was pointed out by an Australian web security expert who stumbled upon the reports in an open online folder that could be easily seen and downloaded.Tony Hunt shared in his blog that the reports belonging to Health Solutions Pathology Pvt Ltd contained information about “general blood tests to tests for foetal signs of Down syndrome to HIV tests”.He also said the damage could be widespread as the folder had been indexed by Google. “So simply shutting down the site won’t remove the full exposure, Google will need to be scrubbed too,” he wrote. This means that the files could be lurking in the cache folders of search engines. The data was probably lying unsecured for about six months now.The leaked files contained names, ages and gender of patients , besides the tests undergone by them. The laboratory removed the files from the web space on Friday afternoon after a news portal contacted them. Hunt had rued how the laboratory could not be contacted for over two days. “I’ve tried emailing multiple addresses (all bounced) and using the contact form (no reply),” he wrote.HS Pathology Private Ltd issued a statement on Friday saying that their website was “hacked”.

Since our staff was being trained to use the new system, we thought we will complete our processes by January,” said the executive.He added that the reports would usually be mailed to a third party, who took printouts and delivered them to the patients. “That was the only time our data went to another server but we were working on that too,” he said.

This, despite doctors working hard to eliminate HIV transmission from mother to child. Approximately, a third of these women are pregnant.According to the latest statistics, over 3,000 women in Gurugram did not undergo HIV tests till October 2016. Of this, 1,215 pregnant women had been counselled to do so. Till October, 14 cases of pregnant women having HIV have been confirmed.According to doctors, it is possible to eliminate transmission, but only if mothers agree to get tested.Dr Himanshu Batra, head of the department of paediatrics at Columbia Asia hospital said, HIV testing is a part of routine screening at all private hospitals. “All of my patients get tested for HIV, no matter what,” he said. It is not the case everywhere, though.In 2015, 7,700 men were counselled at government-run integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC), and 6,660 men opted to get tested for HIV. The number is higher in the case of women, where 21,562 women underwent counselling last year, but only 18,449 opted for testing. The gap is 3,113 women. In 2014, this number was 1,600, in 2013, it was 1,005 and in 2012 it was 899.According to Vijay Kumar, the nodal district officer of the AIDS programme run by the Haryana State AIDS Control Society , there are many reasons behind the figures.“Some of them don’t get tested because they don’t want to wait for the long hours of testing (it takes around two hours for an HIV test). Others think they are not at much risk, and therefore drop out of the tests. We cannot force them as it is done only with their consent,” he said.HIV infection can be caused through various means: sexual transmission, blood transfusion, intravenous drug use and from mother to child. However, 90% of children with HIV contract it from their parents.According to doctors, a complete cure is possible if detection is early.According to National AIDS Control Organisation NACO ), its ‘Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission’ services cover only about 47% annual estimated pregnancies in India. In 2015-16, 12.7 million pregnant women accessed this service.A NACO report says the number of women who are counselled anyway covers only 47% of women, making the number of women who do not get tested significantly large. “In such a situation, complete elimination of HIV transmission from mother-to-child appears to be a distant possibility,” it reads.","['testing', 'counselling', 'doctors', 'transmission', 'sees', 'screening', 'dip', 'tested', 'counselled', 'child', 'women', 'number', 'pregnant', 'hiv']","GURUGRAM: The trend of women not getting tested for HIV, even after being counselled, is rising.
This, despite doctors working hard to eliminate HIV transmission from mother to child.
Of this, 1,215 pregnant women had been counselled to do so.
The number is higher in the case of women, where 21,562 women underwent counselling last year, but only 18,449 opted for testing.

IMA conducted Elisa test as well as NAT on all 49,000 persons who donated blood to IMA 's blood bank over the past three years. The results showed that eight cases of hepatitis B, one HIV and one case of hepatitis C were not detected by Elisa test. However, it was detected using NAT.“Blood transfusion is a lifesaving procedure. But, there is always minimal risk of transmitting blood-borne infections like HIV , hepatitis B and C from the donor to the recipient. The conventional Elisa test employed in blood banks fail to detect infections in the window period,“ said IMA president Dr M Narayanan. At present, only IMA 's blood bank has NAT facility in the city .While donors in the city welcomed the move, they were concerned about two things: cost and whether it is a ploy by private companies to sell their NAT kit. “Studies have shown that NAT is better than Elisa.Government hospitals have to introduce NAT to popularise it,“ said Jishnu Raj, coordinator, Blood Donors, Kerala.While Elisa test costs around Rs 400, NAT costs Rs 800.Both Elisa and NAT are used to determine if a person has antibodies related to certain infectious conditions. However, there is the issue of window period. Window period is the length of time after infection during which a test has a higher chance of incorrectly reporting the absence of disease (false negative). The window period for antibody tests can range from 3 weeks to 6 months.“Nucleic acid tests typically have shorter window periods, and this means that they can be used more reliably , particularly in cases where the exact point of infection isn't entirely clear,“ said Dr Narayanan.NAT was first introduced between 1999 and 2001 in blood banks across France, Germany , Italy, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom . Studies showed that countries that introduced NAT have en countered a decrease in residual risk of viral transmissions. Although, other safety measures such as more stringent selection of blood donors have contributed as well; a marked decrease is evident.The residual risk for Hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission prior to NAT was 0.64 cases per million in France and 3.94 per million in Spain which decreased to 0.1 per million and 2.33 per million respectively after NAT was adopted.HIV NAT yield rates were estimated at 0.3 per million donations in France and Spain as opposed to 0.59 and 2.48 respectively preceding NAT.IMA's move is crucial as India has the second-highest pool of HIV persons estimated at 5.7 million and 3-5% HBV and 1-2% HCV cases reported among a population of almost 1.2 billion. Post-transfusion prevalence of hepatitis has been observed at 1-1.8% for hepatitis B and 0.28-0.5% for hepatitis C and 0.23-0.47 for HIV.“To ensure that blood banks and hospitals shift to NAT, we will soon be conducting a training session for doctors,“ added Dr Narayanan.","['bats', 'test', 'nucleic', 'acid', 'ima', 'elisa', 'c', 'window', 'nat', 'blood', 'detect', 'million', 'hepatitis', 'risk', 'hiv']","KOCHI: Indian Medical Association 's Kochi branch has asked city hospitals to choose nucleic acid test (NAT) over the traditional Elisa test to detect HIV , hepatitis B and C, especially before blood transfusion.This was after IMA, analysed blood samples of 49,000 persons and found that Elisa test failed to detect several infections, thus increasing the risk of transmitting bloodborne diseases from donor to recipient.

Synthetic drugs presently used for HIV treatment have side effects. Researchers hope that since the molecule taken from Aerva lanata is natural, it may not have any negative impact.“We have suggested that medical universities and major research institutions conduct clinical research on our laboratory finding to corroborate the results in patients as we cannot do tests on human beings,“ said Dr Estari Mamidala , one of the researchers.The roots of the weed have been in use by tribals in the forests of Khammam fro ages.Tribals have been using the plant for a number of bacterial and viral diseases. “We collected the weed from jungles as part of the ethnomedical research and found it effective in fighting HIV. In fact, tribals have been using the plant for people with HIV-like symptoms,“ Dr Estari told TOI.Dr Estari along with Dr Rajendra Prasad Gujjeti published the lab results in the latest issue of the Pharmacognosy Journal.“The extracts of Aerva la nata showed inhibitory activity on HIV. The results are remarkable and can be used to develop a new drug for HIV treatment or other infectious diseases caused by the pathogenic micro-organisms, for which plant sterols may play a distinctive role,“ Dr Estari said. He said further work is in progress to evaluate the active compound obtained from the weed. “It has the potential to inhibit the enzyme called HIV reverse transcriptase (RT). The highest inhibition was 91%.The least percentage of inhibition was 77.5%. This is as against the anti-HIV drug, which showed 91.7% efficacy,“ he said.He said the plant contains certain phytochemical compounds that make it a potential future drug for HIV. It has substantial medicinal merit. The plant also helps in lowering blood cholesterol levels. The active compound can also provide molecules which could be useful for the synthesis of new broad spectrum antibiotics for treatment of various infections, besides battling HIV .","['help', 'research', 'fighting', 'results', 'dr', 'hiv', 'plant', 'diseases', 'estari', 'treatment', 'common', 'potential', 'weed']","Synthetic drugs presently used for HIV treatment have side effects.

It’s just that they were prone to catching infections as the virus weakens their immune system.Dr Himanshu, head of anti-retroviral (ART) therapy centre at KGMU for HIV+, said HIV never spreads by one’s saliva, sweat or urine. It is only transmitted if the blood of the infected person comes in contact with a body.

The Kodambakkam resident is HIV positive and has to forgo a day’s wage to travel to a government hospital in Tambaram. At times when the prescribed medicine is unavailable at the hospital, she has to buy the same from outside at a steeper price. While a weak immune system and lack of a nutritious diet make Siriyapushpam susceptible to frequent bouts of illnesses, she says meeting the increasing medical expense gets harder for her each time.Siriyapushpam’s case is not isolated. A complete absence of insurance cover against opportunistic infections (infections caused due to a weak immune system), affects more than 21 lakh people living with HIV (PLHIV) across the country, including 1.42 lakh in TN.It has been more than a month since the HIV and AIDS (Prevention and Control) Act 2014 came into place, but insurers say, they are yet to get guidelines on including such patients in health, life and critical illness segments. The Act protects PLHIV against denial, termination, discontinuation and unfair treatment with regard to employment, educational establishments, healthcare services, residing or renting property, standing for public or private office, and provision of insurance. But without specific instructions, PLHIV in the country remain without cover.According to ‘India HIV Estimation 2015’ report of National AIDS Control Organisation, there were 21.17 lakh PLHIV, including 86,000 newly infected people in 2015. With the highest prevalence being recorded in Nagaland (1.29%), TN’s prevalence rate (0.27%) was higher than the national average of 0.26%.""I have seen cases where hospitals have refused to conduct surgeries to remove uterine fibroids on HIV positive persons. Others charge two to three times the actual cost to operate. If an insurance scheme is introduced for PLHIV, there would be some regulation,"" Kousalya Periasamy, founder of NGO Positive Women’s Network.According to a 2006 UNDP study on the socio-economic impact of HIV and AIDS in India, a person with HIV bears expenses between `25,000 - `30,000 a year. The situation is worse if the earning member in a family is frequently hospitalised.HIV/AIDS and related complications are excluded from critical insurance covers and insurers say they haven’t received instructions to include it in their policies. Health insurance for groups, however, exists. ""In the group health segment, Cigna TTK offers AIDS/HIV cover up to full sum insured under the global health group policy. It covers Indian locals and expatriates working abroad under one umbrella. This cover is available for employees, dependent spouse and children,"" says Sandeep Patel, CEO and MD, Cigna TTK Health Insurance.Star Health & Allied Insurance provides group cover under the NetPlus policy where the proposal has to come from NGOs or government agencies. However, expenses for HIV treatment are excluded as are people with low CD4 count.""Only if companies take the initiative and insure PLHIV for frequent hospitalisations and opportunistic infections can insurance create an impact and gain public trust,"" says Dr S Prakash, senior executive director, Star Health and Allied Insurance.Others say the new law is a step in the right direction. ""With more such steps and availability of more data to enable pricing of products, we can look towards greater inclusion,"" says Ashish Mehrotra, MD and CEO, Max Bupa Health Insurance.But for rural households, 72% of who, according to a 2014 NSSO study, rely on private hospitals for treatment, retail insurance continues to be a dream. Dr Sathish Kumar, country doctor for Solidarity and Action Against HIV Infection in India said cover for PLHIV from lower income groups particularly need attention. Presently, the collective gets such PLHIV enrolled in the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY). Under the scheme, PLHIV from BPL families can get free hospitalisation up to ₹30,000 per family per year.While increasing medical expenses burn a hole in their pockets, patients say unavailability of medicines at ART (Antiretroviral Therapy) centres forces them to make additional trips to the health centre, which robs them of their day’s income.Nutrition is another aspect which seems to have been brushed aside. Dr P Kuganathan , a former programme officer of the state AIDS control programme and consultant (community medicine & infectious disease) at SIMS Hospital says, ""Medicines will work only if PLHIV take nutritious meals,"" adding that the Centre should implement a scheme similar to the mid-day meal for PLHIV.In December 2013, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) announced that people with HIV or other pre-existing illnesses would need to pay a higher premium for life insurance. It also urged companies to continue insuring individuals who contract HIV after buying the policy. This was two months after it issued draft guidelines asking insurers to provide life cover to HIV/AIDS patients.A lot remains to be done, especially in health insurance. At present, an individual with critical injuries or illnesses such as paralysis or cancer is more likely to getting insurance cover than an HIV positive patient on ART.","['aids', 'positive', 'poor', 'cover', 'hiv', 'plhiv', 'say', 'positives', 'health', 'mirage', 'insurance', 'treatment', 'scheme']","The Kodambakkam resident is HIV positive and has to forgo a day’s wage to travel to a government hospital in Tambaram.

The quintessential purpose of life, be it a man or a woman, is the dignity of life and all efforts are to be made to sustain it,” the bench, which also comprised Justices A M Khanwilkar and M M Shantanagoudar, said.It directed that a representative from NGO Koshish should accompany the woman, who is staying in a shelter home, ‘Shanti Kutir’ in Patna, and bring her to Delhi.

The quintessential purpose of life, be it a man or a woman, is the dignity of life and all efforts are to be made to sustain it,” the bench, which also comprised Justices A M Khanwilkar and M M Shantanagoudar, said.It directed that a representative from NGO Koshish should accompany the woman, who is staying in a shelter home, ‘Shanti Kutir’ in Patna, and bring her to Delhi.

It was a very tough fight because the stigma surrounding HIV was all pervasive. Moreover, most people did not understand the nature of HIV. Practically, everybody assumed that one could get HIV by mere association with a person living with HIV (PLHIV). If I recall, the arguments took about three days, about two days on my part and nearly three quarters of a day on the part of the government. The judges had to be made to understand not only the legalities, but the nature of HIV as it was then understood.The case revolved around the Goa Public Health (Amendment) Act, 1985, which permitted the government to mandatorily, without consent, test a person suspected of HIV and on being so found, an individuals’ confidentiality would be breached in addition to possible isolation and incarceration. This is what I called the isolationist law.We actually lost the case because the Goa bench of the Bombay High Court upheld the amendment except for a partial ‘reading down’, in that the Court allowed the person who was being tested to show by other tests that the person was indeed not HIV positive . This had a very deleterious effect initially as we thought the isolationist law would take root in India.However, Dominic D’souza and I, and other friends and comrades were able to resist the replication of the isolationist law of the Goa model in other parts of the country, which was attempted by the central government.In that we were able to create a certain momentum which inured to the benefit of the PLHIV movement. In fact, Dominic D’souza became the first PLHIV activist not only in India, but in the region.When I met Dominic in his last days in Breach Candy hospital, Mumbai, he virtually, in his usual diplomatic way, extracted a promise from me that I shall work for PLHIV community as a lawyer.This ‘tryst with Dominic’ became an obsession with me from 1992-1997, which resulted in the very famous judgement of the Bombay High Court, Mx v. ZY. This landmark judgement, delivered by Justice Tipnis, for the first time provided for the recruitment of PLHIVs in the state sector. Justice Tipnis held that if the person was otherwise qualified (such as having a diploma, degree, etc), was functionally fit and he did not pose a significant risk of transmission to others in the environment, then HIV could not be the basis of any discrimination from him being recruited in the public sector.The success in the MX v. ZY in 1997 put Lawyers Collective’s HIV work on the map such that a lot of gay people started coming to our office. On looking at the situation of gay men the conclusion was inevitable that Sextion 377 of the IPC was a cause of a lot of gay men’s woes in terms of law.This persuaded us to mount a challenge to 377, which was ultimately done in the Delhi high court successfully in 2011, but unfortunately we faced defeat in the Supreme Court, in 2013. The curative petition is still pending in the Supreme Court.Indeed, Dominic D’souza’s case was the first of many, which laid the roadmap of the now HIV Act. The HIV Act contains what we argued in Dominic D’souza’s case in Goa, such as, no testing without informed consent (Section 5), no discrimination or isolation (Section 3) and no breach of confidentiality (Section 8).India has come a long way in treating PLHIV. However, there is a long way to go. We have to remember that India is the pharmacy of the developing and, partly, of the developed world. From 2000 onwards HIV ART triple combination therapy was supplied by India generic companies around the world, though this therapy ART was available from 1996 onwards in the West.However, we were able to supply that in India from the government sector only in 2004, despite the fact that it was Indian generic companies who were supplying ART to the rest of the developing world. Earlier, one had to reach the level of CD4 count of 350 to be on first line ART, it was then changed to 500 and now, the moment you are tested you are to be treated with ART.India, has now taken a policy decision to test and treat as soon as the person is detected to be HIV positive, which was recently announced by Union minister of health J P Nadda . Though this has been announced, India is still far away from the goal, we don’t even comply with the CD4 500 regime till now.Moreover, the HIV Act, which has been recently passed in a cause for concern because under Section 14 of the HIV Act, a caveat is introduced by providing that treatment services would be provided ‘as far as possible’. It appears to many, including the PLHIV community, that ‘as far as possible’ is an escape route for the government to evade its obligations to the community.Though it’s a concern we still have to wait and watch whether it actually becomes a problem in the future.","['court', 'india', 'work', 'case', 'dsouza', 'hiv', 'lawyer', 'plhiv', 'person', 'goa', 'art', 'dominic', 'act', 'promise']","Dominic D’souzas’ was the first case on HIV to come to the Indian courts .

MUMBAI/GOA: It was Valentine’s Day morning in February 1989, and Dominic D’Souza , a 29-year-old living in Parra, a rural parish of north Goa, had just finished breakfast with his mother and aunt when a policeman arrived and whisked him away.Without being told why, Dominic was hustled around the police station, a hospital and badgered with questions about his sexuality and sex life until he was jolted into realising he was a carrier of the HIV virus.It’s been 25 years since the country’s patient zero of the dreaded scourge, who was the first to bear the brunt of ostracism and whose case became the first HIV-related one to reach the Indian courts, succumbed to AIDS.From being handcuffed and left to rot in an abandoned tuberculosis sanatorium to challenging the Goa Public Health Amendment Act, which called for mandatory isolation of HIV-positive persons, Dominic’s legal, medical and emotional journey irrevocably changed not only his own life but became a rallying cry in the struggle for equal rights to treatment and care for those with HIV in the country.Still fit at the time of arrest, Dominic had all along maintained that he was an HIV carrier but not an AIDS patient even as he was being quarantined with rats. Finally, he legally fought his way out 64 days later. On release, he lost his job but chose not to play the victim. Instead, he became India’s first HIV-positive activist.Goa became a centre of AIDS activism with Dominic setting up Positive People , an NGO for the rights of the HIV-infected. Isabel de Santa-Rita Vaz , his friend who’d rallied around him and continued his mission with Positive People, recounts: “His agony was unbearable for us. Dominic knew it wouldn’t be possible to achieve total freedom from infection but wanted to start an organisation that could combat discrimination.”Although he won a partial victory at first when the state amended the Goa Public Health Act and court made detention optional, Dominic lost his life three years on, at 33. “Dominic lived with AIDS, but he lived not to be ashamed,” read his obituary in Goa’s newspapers in 1992, in keeping with his wishes. “He is survived by his twin brother who lives in Sweden, a sister in Mombasa and another brother in the US,” says Vaz.Today, there are an estimated 2.1 million HIV-positive persons in India. Even though diagnosis is no more a death sentence but a chronic illness for which medicines are easier to access, and one can live longer, regular lives, the challenges are many. The stigma it carries and its association with homosexuality, drug use and sex work still impedes the shift in people’s attitudes, says Vaz, adding that the other big challenge is “funding”.Yet, what happened 25 years ago changed the national conversation on the disease and laid the grounds for thelast month. “The dream of having an integrationist approach which requires testing with informed consent and preserving confidentiality and integration of the individual in society has been passed,” says Anand Grover, Dominic’s counsel, who’s been fighting for HIV patients in court since he first met Dominic. “We not only became good friends but worked to oppose the Centre from adopting the Goa Public Health Act model nationally.

Moreover, the caveat it introduced about treatment services being provided ‘as far as possible’ could be an escape route for government to evade its obligations.

The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) previously recommended ART only for those HIV-positive people whose CD4 count (measure of a type of white blood cells) was less than 350 cell millimeter cube on two occasions three months apart.The new 'test and treat' policy means MDACS has to find the 8,000 people who got themselves tested at various government-run testing centres over the last few years, but were not put on ART because they didn't fulfill the previous NACO guidelines. At present, 33,000 positive people are on ART in Mumbai.“We have asked the various Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) in the city to compile a list of people who tested positive at their centre but are not on ART,“ said MDACS additional project director Dr Srikala Acharya . Considering that ICTCs gets a mixed crowd including migrants, it is not likely to be an easy exercise.“We not only have to locate them, we have to get a fresh CD4 count done. Thereafter, we have to counsel them about taking ART,“ said Dr Acharya. The HIV virus remains asymptomatic for years, and it's only when the viral load increases beyond a limit that HIV-positive people start exhibiting outward symptoms such as weight loss and poor immunity against diseases.“Adherence will be a big issue because why would asymptomatic HIV-positive people take strong medicines like ART,“ said infectious diseases specialist and immunologist Dr Om Srivastava .People need to be counseled about the benefits of ART in the long run (see box).Latest research published in the Lancet said life expectancy for young HIV-positive adults has risen by 10 years in the United States and Europe due to antiretroviral therapy. “This meant many patients can expect to live as long as those without HIV,“ said the Lancet report.Moreover, there could an increase in drug resistance if positive people start ART and discontinue it mid-way. “India has to be ready for people developing resistance to firstand second-line drugs. Adequate stocks of secondand third-line drugs should be maintained,“ said Dr Srivastava, who said the private sector had started its 'test and treat' policy over two years ago.However, MDACS's Dr Acharya said that there were adequate stocks of all ART drug combinations in Mumbai.Another senior doctor in the government sector, howe ver, was skeptical about the 'test and treat' policy. “It seems to be a pharma-driven agenda to boost sales of medicines,“ said the doctor.","['test', 'hivpositive', 'policy', 'ministry', 'line', 'dr', 'positive', '8000', 'hiv', 'treat', 'searches', 'health', 'started', 'treatment', 'mumbai', 'art', 'orders', 'mdacs']","MUMBAI: The Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) has started a painstaking search for 8,000 HIV positive persons since the Union ministry of health issued a circular on May 5 stating that all people living with HIV (PLHIV) be started on anti retroviral therapy (ART) regardless of their blood parameters or age.

However, six years on, doctors say they are seeing a rise in those testing positive for syphilis among other sexually transmitted diseases, even as the prevalence of HIV is on the decline.Data accessed by TOI from Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TANSACS) has shown that from 2014 to 2016, the number of those who tested positive for HIV went down from 16,708 to 11,395 ­ a 30% decline, with the number of new cases detected decreasing by half from around 2,700. The second most common STD was Herpes genetalis -marked by genital pain and sores in some, and no symptoms in most --which, too, went down by close to 40% from 2014-2016. The biggest surprise for officials was the increase in syphilis cases from around 1,300 in 2014 to 1,700 the following year.“This could be because of better awareness and surveillance,“ said Dr K Senthil Raj, TANSACS director, adding that many of these cases were picked up in Chennai, Salem and Nammakkal. Researchers say syphilis is on a gradual incline across the country along with other STDs like genital infection caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) and, in some pockets, Herpes genetalis.“And in some groups like men who have sex with men, the prevalence of syphilis is significantly high,“ said Dr R R Gangakhedkar, director-incharge of National AIDS Research Institute. He said the prevalence of HIV has decreased across the country because of better intervention by Anti-Retroviral Therapy centres.“While these centres cut the HIV transmission by 93%, alot of other STDs go missed,“ he added. While the transmission efficiency of HIV is low, varying between one in 100 to one in 1000, syphilis occurs in one in 30 people who has come in contact with a carrier. On the brighter side, he said most of those with STDs come at an early stage because of better awareness and hence treated before complications set in.India records 30 million episodes of STDs annually , of which the government treats about 10 million.While government facilities target high-risk groups like the transgender community , female sex workers and homosexual groups, private labs say they have been seeing a steady increase in those reporting with STDs among the general population, especially in the 18-35 years age group.“We have seen a 20% rise of cases of HPV and Herpes. Some of the STDs are detected when the person presents with infertility-related problems,“ said Dr Anita Suryanarayan, vice-president, operations (south India), Metropolis Healthcare Ltd . While the government has several targeted interventions for promoting safe sex, awareness is relatively low among youngsters from the middle and upper class, she felt.","['stds', 'syphilis', 'cases', 'prevalence', 'groups', 'dr', 'herpes', 'decline', 'hiv', 'sex', 'say']","He had become familiar with the symptoms while undertaking a survey in the Western Ghats in the late 70s.

They will get government grants, reservation, scholarships and hostel facilities like the other disadvantaged students. The notification has already been sent to all WBBSE schools,” a senior school education department official said.The SC order came after a Delhi-based NGO, working with HIV/AIDS patients, submitted that children living with HIV-positive parents or affected by HIV were suffering segregation and, in many cases, were being compelled to leave school even though there was zero risk of transmission of the disease. The apex court then asked state governments to consider issuing this notification.“We got some cases, mainly from Howrah, South 24-Parganas and Murshidababd, where schools were under pressure from guardians of other students to ostracise HIV-positive students,” an official said.A recent National Aids Control Organisation report says nearly 22,000 children in Bengal (out of the 1.45 lakh under-15 population) are suffering from HIV. “This number is huge and increasing.

Among the infected were 1,567 newborns who probably didn’t get the preventive drugs on time, while 200 adults got the disease due to transfusion with infected blood.This is the second year in a row when the state held on to the dubious distinction of reporting maximum cases after occupying the second and third positions through the last decade. Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka were the only states to report 20,000-plus new infections in 2016-17. RTI data obtained from the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) showed while the state is recording a year-on-year decline, the rate is less than many other high-prevalence states. The state also reported the most mother-to-child transmissions in the country. In the last five years, at least 10,449 newborns got the infection despite the availability of the triple-drug regimen that cuts chances of transmission by 99%.Head of state-run JJ Hospital in Byculla, Dr Ashok Anand, said they have not delivered a single HIV-positive baby in the last three to four years. “Giving anti-retroviral to babies soon after birth as well as putting the mother on anti-retroviral therapy early has proved to be very effective,” he said. Chetan Kothari, who filed the RTI said, “It is shameful that even today babies are getting the deadly disease when drugs are readily available.”Parimal Singh, who heads the Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS), defended the programme and said not just mother-to-child transmission but HIV among general and high-risk populations has been on a decline. “It must be taken into consideration that we came to the top spot only after Andhra Pradesh was divided. As far as babies getting HIV is concerned, today HIV+ mothers are no longer afraid of giving birth and this is the programme’s achievement,” he said. MSACS’ data shows from 2009-10 when HIV positivity in general population was around 5.23%, it has dropped to less than 1% today.State’s public health minister Dr Deepak Sawant added Maharashtra is in a vulnerable position given the huge load of migration. Data also shows a dip in transmission of the disease among homosexuals, bisexuals and transgenders. A few stakeholders however contest intervention to contain HIV in the state has lost steam. Arup Mukherjee, secretary general of the Nagpur-based Indian Red Cross Society, said a fund crunch has been hampering the project for the last two years. “The attrition rate is huge as NGOs are struggling to pay salaries on time. Often testing kits are not available,” he said. Sawant said NACO is responsible for providing 75% of funds. “The state is doing its bit,” he said.Singh added Maharashtra and Mumbai are role models for their HIV control strategies. Of course, even after three decades, both the state and city remain hotbeds for the infection.","['data', 'control', 'infections', 'transmission', 'hiv', 'maharashtra', 'states', 'general', 'disease', 'babies', 'state', 'detected', '201617']","Mumbai: Maharashtra detected the highest number of new HIV infections among states in 2016-17, accounting for 16% of the country’s 1.84 lakh fresh cases.

The move is, however, being seen as a ‘ridiculous’ one by social activists as they see it as an infringement of privacy of people living with HIV.When a 45-year-old HIV patient reached Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre at Sawai Man Singh Hospital to get medicines, the healthcare staff asked her to submit Aadhaar card’s photocopy. “They asked me if I have Aadhaar card and that I should submit its photocopy,” the patient who is taking medicine for HIV for over 10 years, said.The RSACS has sent messages to all its ART centres, which provide medicines to people with HIV/AIDS across the state, to collect Aadhaar from beneficiaries.“Other departments are also linking social benefit schemes with Aadhaar, so we have also decided to link it. But, we have not made it compulsory for getting medicines. If a person does not have Aadhaar, he/she will continue to get medicines. We will not stop providing them medicines,” said Dr S S Chauhan, director, RSACS.In the state, there are 23 ART centres that provide testing and treatment facilities to 55,000 odd people living with HIV.Officials said that Aadhaar will help in keeping a track on beneficiaries (people living with HIV), who go missing during treatment. Also, through Aadhaar, department will ensure that a particular beneficiary is not registered at different ART centres. They will generate a whole database online, which will have their Aadhaar number. If a person goes to an ART for HIV testing, the online software through Aadhaar will detect automatically if he is already registered at some other ART.Reacting on it, social activists are apprehensive that this may increase risk of revealing identity of people living with HIV/AIDS.“HIV is a severe privacy issue. But it has been seen in the past that your Aadhaar is compromised at many places. There are instances of it being stolen. The question arises that how the state government will keep such database safe,” said activist Nikhil Dey.Dey said, “Once it’s leaked, how they (those who get it) will use it. There is a stigma attached to HIV, so it is ridiculous to collect Aadhaar from those who are already marginalised. If they made it mandatory, there are chances of exclusion of those who do not have Aadhaar from getting benefits of government schemes.”Social activists termed the step as “ridiculous”. Collecting Aadhaar from all people living with HIV/AIDS is quite challenging at a time when such people living with HIV/AIDS registered at ART do not share even their original name and address to ensure their original identity is not revealed to anyone, even at ART centres.","['ridiculous', 'social', 'dept', 'medicines', 'patients', 'hiv', 'submit', 'wants', 'living', 'aadhaar', 'state', 'centres', 'art', 'raj']","Jaipur: Those living with HIV will now have to submit their Aadhaar card numbers to Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RSACS).

While the overall HIV positivity in blood units collected in the city has been decreasing, it seems that the infection rate at the National AIDS Control Organisation-supported blood banks has remained stagnant for the last four years. An average of 480 units of HIV-infected blood is detected every year. Interestingly, HIV positivity in non-NACO blood banks has been showing a steady decrease.A third of the 61 blood banks in Mumbai are supported by NACO and most of these are in public hospitals.Dr Shrikala Acharya, assistant project director of MDACS, said as per National Blood Transfusion Council (NBTC) guidelines blood banks should collect information about donors in case they need to be contacted for counselling or treatment in the event of their reports indicating positive for an infection. “It’s a part of the pre-donor counselling that is supposed to be done before blood collection. It is not mandatory, but it is a part of the guidelines,” she said.Acharya added, “Often blood units are collected through camps, where a person may or may not have given his contact details.

The whole episode had a whiff of alleged discrimination against the woman she is suffering from a disease, which it seems is still considered to be a social taboo here.The unprecedented turn of events left the patient, with an extremely low haemoglobin count and her relatives shaken. “I was told by Sultania hospital doctors to return to the government hospital in Sehore, where I gave birth to a baby. Sehore doctors referred me to Bhopal by saying that I needed care at a higher hospital. I feel like a total outcast. Rights of patients like me, who are suffering from HIV infection, need to be protected.”The patient was referred to the state capital, hours after she delivered a baby on Tuesday morning. Her newborn was admitted to the neonatal care unit in Sehore. In her mid-20s, the woman underwent a normal delivery in the Sehore hospital and after being given some much-needed blood, her condition was expected to stabilise.The woman’s relatives also alleged discrimination and saw no reason for her referral. “My sister was shivering and had high temperature. But, we could very well sense that she was not welcome in the hospital, like other regular patients,” said the patient’s sister. The family travelled to Bhopal by road and reached the Sultania hospital. They are residents of a village some 22 kilometres away from Sehore town.At around 4 pm on Tuesday, Sehore-based government hospital gynaecologist Dr Amita Shirvatava explained the situation by saying “The patient had a medical condition, including low blood pressure and pulmonary issues. It was my opinion that the patient would be better served at a higher centre.”Speaking to TOI, chief medical and research officer (CMHO) Dr A Qureshi said, “Prima facie there is no indication of discrimination. However, a full report has been sought from the concerned department.”“I am aware of an HIV positive patient coming to the hospital. However, her admission or otherwise is not known to me. I would have to investigate the matter,” said Dr Aruna Kumar, the head of department of gynaecology at Sultania hospital.After a call to the CMHO, within a span of two hours hospital officials informed that the HIV patient was admitted again in Sehore. She was discharged from Sultania hospital and taken back to Sehore within hours of being referred to Bhopal.“The woman was referred after a successful intervention. There is no discrimination in the matter,” said Dr Malti Arya, the doctor who was on duty when the patient was referred to Bhopal.Sources said few months back, another HIV positive patient, who reached the same government hospital for her delivery, was forced to opt for a delivery at a private hospital.","['bhopal', 'sultania', 'discrimination', 'dr', 'hospital', 'hiv', 'sehore', 'referred', 'woman', 'run', 'mp', 'mother', 'patient']","BHOPAL: An HIV positive woman was referred from a Sehore hospital to Bhopal but was sent back to Sehore — all in a single day’s time — on Tuesday.

We have tied up with the Punjab State AIDS Control Society, which will give us the medicines.

This is unaffordable. How can anyone take a reimbursement when there is no paying capacity?”Out of the 300 patients getting second line treatment from PGI, 30 are from Chandigarh, 90 from Haryana and 120 from Punjab. SACS, which is supposed to procure medicines, blames NACO for the situation, while NACO officials feel otherwise. “We supplied drugs to Punjab a few days ago. There is no shortage of funds from NACO. In fact, it is the responsibility of SACS to provide these medicines,” said Dr J S Malhi, regional coordinator, NACO.According to the Network of People living with HIV/Aids, Chandigarh, second line treatment drugs which are out of stock include Lamivudine, Zidovudine and Abacavir. These medicines are supposed to be given in combination. Missing even one renders the course incomplete. “Even children face the same problem.

Going by the Data of District Aids Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU), of late, there has been an increase in cases between the age group of 40 to 49 years. Experts say the major reason for the change in trend in the viral disease is due to extramarital affairs.District Program Manager (DPM) of DAPCU, Trichy Dr SM Manivannan says, “The trend has changed after 2011. Analysis shows that the trend is a consequence of illicit affairs among married people. But on the whole, the prevalence of HIV-AIDS is declining.”Earlier, the incidence was prevalent among people in the age group of 30 to 39 years, due to the unawareness of the high risk behavior groups - Female Sex Workers (FSW), Men Sex with Men (MSM) and transgender (TG). “HIV positive was high among the risk behavior groups, but after 2011 the trend declined and common people too have been tested positive,” said Dr Manivannan.Stating that the number of infected people is under control in Trichy district, the DPM said that currently 5,500 people were on Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) treatment here. The number included FSW, MSM, TG and normal people.Few years ago, there was a panic among HIV-infected people that the viral infection was the end of their life. Now, doctors term it as a chronically manageable disease. “If a patient is regularly on ART, the life expectancy of the patient will not decrease,” said Dr R Sharmila at ART Centre inside Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH). ART is a tablet which was prescribed to those who had CD4 count below 300. However, the tablet has been made available to all infected people irrespective of their CD4 count.“The regular follow-up on patients and intake of ART tablet increases the longevity of the patients. If anyone was missing out on treatment, the Target Intervention (TI)-NGOs will keep track of them and bring them back on track for treatment,” he said.","['track', 'extra', 'cases', 'art', 'positive', 'trend', 'dr', 'viral', 'spike', 'hiv', 'tablet', 'tg', 'marital', 'treatment', 'affairs', 'trichy']","TRICHY: Incidence of people tested positive for HIV has witnessed a major change in Trichy .

Though 110 pregnant women were detected HIV positive in 2016-17, the number has decreased as compared to the 2015-16 figures that stood at 153 women affected with the virus. This drop is because of the awareness drives being carried out by various organisations,” said Ratan Gadhave, district programme officer of theDAPCU.The department, along with 33 NGOs, conduct awareness drives on regular basis and focus more on the people belonging to the high risk communities.“Out of those who fall under the high risk category, the highest number of people tested positive were migrant workers and and truck drivers.

In another part of the country, a blood transfusion brought Radhika’s* dreams crashing down. But instead of letting their HIV+ve diagnoses fill their lives with negativity, they decided to stay positive. Brought together by a twist of fate and the late Dr Suniti Solomon, the pioneer of AIDS research in India, the couple is now proud parents to a 16-year-old, and productive members of society.""When I was first diagnosed with HIV, I was terrified,"" says Chennai-based Arun, who was referred to Dr Solomon of YRG CARE. ""She reassured me that I could still lead a normal life as long as I took medication, and adopted a healthy lifestyle. Getting to know other people living with HIV helped me overcome my fears,"" says Arun, who gave up smoking and drinking.Two years later, when Dr Solomon asked him if he was looking for a life partner, Arun was ready to take the next step forward. ""I hadn’t told my parents or siblings that I am HIV+ve so they were keen to see me married. I wanted a companion but didn’t want to spoil the life of another person, so I decided to marry a woman who was also HIV+ve,"" says Arun, an engineer.Dr Solomon, who documented the first cases of HIV in India in 1986 among sex workers, took voluntary retirement in 1993 to establish YRG Care. In the latter part of her career — as people began living longer with generic anti-retroviral medications and faced the same pressure at home to get married — she began helping healthy patients find life partners. Though the centre has played ‘matchmaker’ for 30 couples so far, Arun and Radhika’s was the first success story.With Dr Solomon’s encouragement, Arun decided to meet prospective brides. That’s when Dr Solomon heard about Radhika, a young woman from Maharashtra. And once Arun met her and her family, he was quick to make up his mind.Radhika, who takes tuitions at home, was also willing to take the plunge. ""I didn’t want to be alone for the rest of my life, and wanted the emotional support a partner can give,"" she says. The next hurdle was convincing his parents who were still unaware that he is HIV+ve. Arun’s family was quick to come around and the only barrier was language.But there was another, bigger challenge ahead. The couple, who got married in July 2001, discovered that Radhika was pregnant in September. ""We were scared but both of us were on medication and our son, born in 2002, is HIV-ve,"" says Arun.Till today, they have not disclosed their HIV+ve identity to friends, Arun’s family, or their son.""There is still some stigma attached to the disease as people have misconceptions about it,"" says Radhika. ""But there is nothing to fear. We take our medicines every day, eat healthy and go to the hospital every six months to check our CD4 (white blood cell counts) and viral loads,"" says Radhika.Arun says getting married and having a child has given direction to his life. ""If you live on your own, you can get depressed. My outlook to life changed after marriage, and now I have a son to live and work for, which gives purpose to my life,"" he says.He has just one word of advice for people. ""If you are in the high-risk group, do go to the doctor and get an HIV test done. With timely and regular treatment, you can lead a normal life.""(*Names have been changed to protect identity)","['pulled', 'gave', 'hivve', 'solomon', 'dr', 'married', 'parents', 'hiv', 'radhika', 'love', 'life', 'arun', 'hope', 'healthy']","""When I was first diagnosed with HIV, I was terrified,"" says Chennai-based Arun, who was referred to Dr Solomon of YRG CARE.

The test essentially tells whether the treatment regimen is working or not by measuring the amount of HIV virus in a patient’s blood.The National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) has already shortlisted laboratories across the country that would be scaled up to carry out the tests. However, it may be a while before every patient on antiretroviral therapy (ART) qualifies to undergo the expensive test, which costs between Rs 6,000 and Rs 8,000 in a private laboratory.In 2013, the WHO had recommended the viral load-test be carried out within six months of starting an individual on ART and be repeated at the end of that year. Subsequently, it should be carried out annually. People living with HIV and NGOs have since been fighting for the test to be made routinely available and more accessible.“From February onward, 532 ART centres across the country will have the viral load-testing facility. In the initial phases, it will be offered to children below the age of five years, people taking treatment for five years and those suffering from HIV-TB co-infection. They have been chosen keeping the criticality of their condition in mind. The test will subsequently be available to all 1.2 million people on ART treatment in the country,” said Dr R S Gupta of NACO’s Care, Support and Treatment division. The civic-run KEM and Nair hospitals are likely to be the centres in the city.Currently, the test is selectively offered at the state-run JJ Hospital, where patients have to go through the stringent scrutiny of a committee.“The body takes between four and six months only to decide who will undergo the test. It’s unfortunate that in the absence of a viral load-test, the programme solely relies on CD4 count,” said Ganesh Acharya, a member of the Mumbai Aids Forum (MAF). CD4 is an indicator of the body’s immune system. “But it’s only part information about what the virus is doing with the immune system. A high viral load in the body will usually, but not always, mean a low CD4 count,” said infectious disease expert Dr Om Srivastava, who recommends viral load-testing every six months to one year.“Because of the unavailability of the test, patients also often don’t realize when they have become resistant to the first line or second line drugs,” said Poonam Patkar, secretary of MAF.Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) India that offers viral load-testing to KEM patients as a special model, run in collaboration with the Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS), said they have got great results in picking treatment failures early and improving outcomes by addressing non-adherence in patients. The MSF data collated from KEM has shown that 90% of the patients were responding to the treatment offered under the national programme as their viral loads were suppressed.","['test', 'offered', 'mumbai', 'measure', 'viral', 'soon', 'patients', 'hiv', 'virus', 'blood', 'country', 'treatment', 'months', 'art', 'loadtesting']","MUMBAI: Following years of protest, the Centre is set to roll out the viral load-testing for HIV/AIDS patients in the next six months across the country.

It has been conceptualised by Peter Borges , founder and CEO of the NGO, Human Touch “This club will help young people allocate time to tend to their emotional needs at a critical juncture in their life, where establishing peer relationships is particularly important. Unlike other teenagers, there is a heightened risk among HIV+ adolescents to feel excluded and isolated.

A majority live with their families, sometimes with single parents and extended families. There are also a substantial number of orphans, close to 40 of whom are housed in three institutions in Tivim, Cavelossim and Rivona.Although ALHIV still face great difficulties in having their voices heard, they also have the potential to be powerful agents of change. Bloom and Blossom, which will conduct its meetings in the Human Touch office at Agasaim, could be a good place to start.“They will better placed to advocate issues that concern them and should be given opportunities for engagement in policy-making, too.

There is also a demand for a revitalized community-wide response to support them,” Borges says.“Adequate treatment, literacy and the right to make decisions about one’s own health are central to empowering ALHIV to be able to engage in decisions about their own care.

They claim to have come across two cases wherein HIV patients were asked to wait for some time to get treatment after the doctors learnt they were HIV patients.The first patient, who had a heart ailment, was asked to come back after a few weeks. The second patient, a woman who was suffering from uterine prolapse, was told there were no beds at the hospital, they said.Deepa, a non-community coordinator, claimed that doctors do not deny providing treatment but delay it. “They also ask for proof whether they had given them in writing that they wouldn’t treat them.

The number of HIV infected patients which was high in 2008 and 2009 gradually declined, claimed DAPCU officials.The downward trend was attributed to awareness among people about safety measures such as condoms.“The single most important occupation affected by the HIV remains the driver profession. Previously, long distance drivers were vulnerable to HIV infection because of their long separation from their wives and the prevalence of female sex workers. Now, all kinds of drivers have come in the vulnerable group,” said Manivannan.Around 11,000 people were undergoing HIV screening test in all the 33 ICTC in Trichy every month.

The 36-year-old mother of two dug into his bag to find a sari, a lipstick and wilted flowers. Her husband, she later found, was a bisexual cross-dresser.Four years on, Savitha remains married to the same man. Her voice — narrating her husband’s affairs with other men — is among those documented by researchers who studied HIV-related risks among married men who have sex with men (MSM) and their wives According to a 2012 study by National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), MSM are at 12 to15 times higher risk of contracting HIV compared to other men. The recent study found that the HIV-related risks for the spouses of MSM were multiple, yet they are not covered under any intervention programmes of the government.Forty six MSMs were interviewed across five states including the cities of Chennai and Madurai. Of these, 13 women were aware of their husbands’ sexual orientation. Men in these marriages were the primary decision-makers about sex and condom use.""The men used condoms inconsistently with their male partners,"" said Sunil Solomon of Y R Gaitonde Centre for AIDS Research and Education, a co-author of the study. ""The women in these relationships are vulnerable but rarely feature in the country’s HIV intervention programmes. The initiatives mostly address the experiences and perspectives of husbands and their male partners, but not their wives,"" said Solomon, who facilitated the interviews for two teams from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and Durham University.The few women who were interviewed said they came to know about their husbands’ same-sex preference by accident. The men in the study reported having multiple male, and a few female, extramarital sexual partners.Forty-year-old Vasanth* from Hyderabad, who blamed his family for forcing him to marry, was among those who had not disclosed their orientation to their wives. ""If I tell my wife about my relationship with men, she may harm herself. What will happen if she tells our families? I may be making a mistake, but I cannot trouble her. So my relationship remains a secret,"" he said.The study pointed to the high-risk sexual behaviour among MSM and a higher prevalence of HIV among married MSM than unmarried ones. The pressure on them to conform to heteronormative masculine norms leads to hurried and unsafe sex with multiple partners.Many MSMs are also victims of blackmail. ""Their male partners threaten to expose them to their wives if they don’t listen to their demands. In the process, they end up having sex without protection,"" said Jaya, general manager of Sahodaran, which operates a helpline for the LGBT community in Chennai.Some of the couples surveyed for the study had separated after the women got to know about their husbands’ sexual preferences, while some remained married but no longer had a sex. However, a majority of participants continued to have sex both with their wives and partners. A few of them said they encouraged their wives to have extramarital relationships as they were not attracted to them. Women said they remain in these marriages due to cultural and economic pressures, and some for their children.Some women, described pressure from their husbands to have anal sex against their wishes. ""Accounts from both husbands and wives in our study indicate that husbands are the primary sexual decision-makers; some men clearly consider it a right. The men interviewed said they did not feel that using condom with their wives was ""necessary"", even when they had unsafe sex with other partners. ‘I have a medical check-up every three months, so what is the need to use condom with my wife?’ asked a 27-year-old bisexual man in Madurai. Condoms were only seen as a birth control measure and not to prevent sexually transmitted diseases,"" said Solomon. ""But, several participants we interviewed were actively seeking a pregnancy at the time of the interview, and consequently avoided using condoms with their wives,"" he added.The study said there is an urgent need for interventions to address HIV-related risk posed to wives without the unwanted disclosure of husbands’ same-sex behaviour. ""For instance, engagement of these husbands in pre-exposure prophylaxis (taking HIV medicines daily to lower chances of getting infected) could reduce the men’s own risk of HIV, and thereby also reduce the risk of onward transmission to their wives.""

The Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) will initiate the project on a pilot basis at the antiretroviral therapy centres in Madras Medical College and at the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Egmore, which have around 5,000 HIV-positive patients enrolled in the state programme.K Senthil Raj, TANSACS project director, said the patients will also be given a login id, so that they can access their records, including lab results and next appointment with doctors, through their phones. “Starting from the counsellor to the staff nurse and then finally the doctor, details of the patients will be fed into the system. The doctors will have a dashboard with the patient’s medical history,” he said.At present, 1.2 lakh people with HIV are on the antiretroviral therapy programme run by the government.Officials say once a patient tests positive for HIV, the ART centre maintains a ‘white card’ with the patient’s details, while the patient is given a notebook that carries information on their drugs intake and their CD4 count – an important indicator of the immune function and the strongest predictor of HIV progression. A doctor at an ART centre here said many of these cards are simply discarded. “Walk into any of these centres and you will see these cards lying in some corner, gathering dust. We usually refer to the notebooks these patients bring. Mostly we go by the information they provide,” admitted the doctor.The TANSACS director, too, said poor documentation was a problem. “We also have duplication. A patient who registers at an ART centre in one district later moves to a centre in another district and enrolls as a new patient,” he said, adding that maintaining electronic records will do away with this challenge. “We will also be able to track them better.”Tamil Nadu has AIDS testing centres at all district headquarters with more than 55 ART centres and 750 Integrated (Voluntary) and Confidential Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) under the National AIDS Control Programme at district level government hospitals and medical colleges across the state. Patients, who are confirmed HIV-positive, visit ART centres at least once a month for drugs and testing.While NGOs and experts working with people living with HIV have welcomed the move, they said digitalisation could also raise concerns on privacy. “Many of them lie low as they don’t want people around them to know they are infected.

The good news is that the deadly viral disease continues to be on a decline among general population. The worrying part: In certain pockets of the state, the disease is raging among high-risk populations like female sex workers.According to the HSS, Maharashtra is 16th in terms of HIV prevalence, a positive shift of four places since the last survey in 2014-15. From 0.29%, the prevalence has reduced to 0.26%. An official from the Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS) said it was a significant drop as the HIV prevalence is now lower than the national average of 0.28%.But experts say it’s still not time to rejoice as certain sites catering to high-risk populations such as men having sex with men (MSM), injecting drug users and female sex workers have shown a significant prevalence. Though Maharashtra is one of the states to record less than 5% HIV positivity in female sex workers, there are four sites where the prevalence has been found to be 5%. At one site, it was around 10%. Among the female sex workers in the state, the prevalence (3.48%) is more than double the national average (1.56%).Nagpur-based NGO Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS) that has been working with female sex workers said migration has emerged as a major challenge over the years. “Commercial sex workers have started migrating and moving out of traditional pockets making it difficult to track, test or treat them. It poses a direct threat to the general population,” said Hemlata Lohave from IRCS. She added that dwindling financial resources, too, have made their job difficult. “Often we are working without funds for months. Even now, for instance, we haven’t received money for the last quarter. We regularly lose trained workers as we can’t pay salaries,” she said.Among MSMs, the state is fifth on the national chart with the prevalence hovering around 4.69%, which is higher than the national average of 2.69%. However, in HSS 2014-15, the HIV prevalence among female sex workers was 7.4% and 4.9% among MSMs.Mumbai, too, is one of the sites with high HIV prevalence among truckers. There were nine sites with more than 1% HIV prevalence among long-distance truckers, including Mumbai with 1.2% prevalence.The MDACS official said the state is working on newer strategies. “We are aware that infections are still high in metropolitan cities. In high-risk pockets, we are testing at the community level. We are also looking at multi-month dispensation of antiretroviral drugs so that a patient can come to us once in three months rather than every month,” he said.","['prevalence', 'highrisk', 'sex', 'sites', 'working', 'rages', 'workers', 'female', 'state', 'groups', 'national', 'pockets', 'wanes', 'maha', 'hiv']","MUMBAI: The recently released HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) report has some good as well as worrying news for the state.

It will measure the quantity of HIV virus in patients and help doctors decide their treatment regime.Hitherto, the test was conducted only after the first line of drugs failed, which would happen after 5-7 years of patients being diagnosed with HIV, and result in them losing golden time in starting new medicines.On Saturday, Naco instructed all state governments to get patients to undergo routine viral load tests and check mortality rate. A staggering 80,173 people have died of HIV over the past decade in Karnataka, according to the death audit conducted by Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS).A total of 3.1 lakh people living with HIV (PLHIV) have registered for ART in the state. Across the country, an estimated 21 lakh HIV positive patients are registered with 525 ART centres. Bengaluru has seven such centres.While 3,16,252 people living with HIV have registered for ART treatment in Karnataka as on December 2017, only 1, 65,917 of them actively turn up for follow-ups. The rest are either dead or don’t visit the centres.The practice till date was to get a patient, whose blood tests positive for HIV, to undergo a CD4 count before starting anti-retro viral drugs. CD4 count is a prognostic indicator where a higher number indicates a stronger immune system. Henceforth, the patient will have to undergo a viral load test too while registering for ART treatment.“The cost of viral load test in the private sector ranges from Rs 4,000-6,000 and not all can afford it. The government will be spending Rs 1,200 per test,” said an officer from KSAPS.This Naco move will be implemented from February 8 through M/s Metropolis Healthcare Limited under a public-private partnership ( PPP ) project. In the first year, the agency will conduct 2.1 lakh tests. The remaining patients will be covered in a phased manner.“Currently, the programme was using targeted viral load testing to confirm suspected treatment failure owing to clinical or immunological failure of the patient. From now on, patients on ART will be monitored via viral load test at regular intervals. The result will allow early detection of potential treatment failure,” a senior officer in KSAPS said.Naco had also set a timeline to be followed while conducting viral load testing. “For patients on the first line of treatment, the test should be done twice in the first year, once every six months. From the second year onwards, it should happen once a year. For second/third line patients, it must be conducted once every six months after the patient’s initiation on ART,” said KSAPS officers.However, NGOs closely working with people living with HIV (PHIV) in creating awareness have questioned the government’s partnership with a private entity. “There is a HIV law in place and the rules are likely to be framed by April 2018. Even before formulating the rules, why has the government tied up with a private party? Besides, if the private agency conducts tests only on 2.1 lakh of the total 21 lakh people registered for ART treatment in the country, it will cover only 10%. What about the rest? Instead, viral load tests should have been mandated for all HIV patients once every six months,” said David Bodapatti, who has been working with PLHIV.HIV positive people on active ART careAdult males: 69,376Adult females: 84,409Transgenders, Transsexuals: 373Male children: 6,443Female children: 5,316Total: 1,65,917Source: KSAPS (figures as on Dec 2017)","['treatment', 'test', 'load', 'registered', 'patients', 'mandates', 'naco', 'check', 'viral', 'mortality', 'lakh', 'tests', 'art', 'hiv']","BENGALURU: In what could be a game changer in treating HIV patients, the National AIDS Control Organization (Naco) has decided that all patients registered for anti-retroviral therapy (ART) will undergo viral load testing.

While 25 of them have tested positive for HIV and are undergoing treatment in Kanpur, pathology reports of the remaining 13 are awaited.Officials fear the figure could go up as new cases are reported. The fact came to light during health check-up camps organised recently in three localities of Unnao's Bangarmau tehsil by community health centre (CHC) officials with help from an NGO.""The quack used the syringe on 38 people of whom 25 have contracted the virus in some villages of Bangarmau tehsil in Unnao.

Deep Chand (name changed), sobbing inconsolably , is an embodiment of that mortifying scare. In the past three months, 38 people from this locality of Bangarmau tehsil have been found HIV positive at screening camps in the past three months. The needle of suspicion is pointed towards a quack, Rajendra Yadav , who has been held.Till a few months ago, Deep Chand was just like most men from Prem Ganj, working as a 'palledar' (loader) at the nearby grain market. But a few months ago, his body started saying 'no' to humongous sacks he would carry on his back to make a living. Continuous excruciating pain in the lower back took him to Yadav's Station Road clinic in Bangarmau, the destination for many in his neighbourhood needing cheap medical help. But relief eluded him. Last month, at a camp in Prem Ganj to screen HIV cases he, along with his wife and son, tested positive. Now, he has to report to Kanpur ART Centre, 50 km away, for regular check-up and medication which is free.He also has four daughters. But fearing worst, he has not made them undergo the test. ""I am not fit and don't earn like before. What will happen if they, too, are tested positive? Medicine is free, but I don't have money to take six people to Kanpur. I can't even afford the cost of copies and pencils,"" he vents his angst.Two other nearby villages under the virus onslaught are Chakmeera and Kidmiyapur. Among the victims is a 70-year-old and also six-year-old girl. Her parents, however, are not infected. This has flummoxed local health officials.Rajendra Yadav, who would run his clinic from the corridor of an old Sanskrit school on the Station Road and is said to have infected many from the locality with infected syringes, was Dr 'Fixit' for the people. As per Deepu, a local youth, patients would make a beeline before his clinic before he would open it at 9am. Till the time he would call it a day around 11pm, he would have seen more than 150 patients.""People from adjoining areas would also throng his dispensary. He used to charge Rs 10 for three doses of medicine and an injection shot. He would carry a 'jhola' in which he usually kept his medical kit, including used syringes, which he would wash from the hand-pump water,"" Deepu says.Prem Ganj came under the radar of health officials in November last when 13 people from the locality tested HIV positive at a camp held by UP State Aids Control Society. At three repeat camps in the last week of January, 25 more cases popped up. “Nearly 270 people from Prem Ganj had got themselves examined at the camps out of which 25 tested positive. Now, people are scared and are not willing to get themselves tested,” says Sunil Kumar, a local municipal corporator.","['prem', 'locality', '5000', 'local', 'clinic', 'living', 'tested', 'town', 'positive', 'ganj', 'fear', 'unnao', 'months', 'infected', 'hiv']","BANGARMAU ( UNNAO ): Prem Ganj , a settlement of about 5,000 people, is living under the shadow of an unknown fear.

The health department issued fresh guidelines to all district chief medical and health officers (CMHO) on Wednesday to rein in these frauds.What adds to the worry is that Madhya Pradesh State AIDS Control Society does not list these cases in its HIV sentinel surveillance. As per MPSACS data, there are 7,021 intravenous drug users being monitored at their anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centres.

There is a high percentage of patients battling these deadly infections in the city,” pointed out Mujtaba Hasan Askari , president Helping Hand Foundation , an NGO which works with HIV patients.Recently, over 50 people were found to be infected with HIV in Unnao in Uttar Pradesh due to use of unsafe medical devices. Experts say mushrooming of blood banks, improper screening of blood and lack of checks were to be blamed for the spread of HIV.“The Telangana State Aids Control Society (TSACS) data may not reflect the true picture of new cases being infected through syringes and blood transfusion. Also, the fact that blood transfusion standards are not maintained as many private blood banks have mushroomed. Absence of checks, regulations and safety protocols make matters worse,” Askari pointed out.Interestingly, the latest and most-updated technology available to detect HIV, nucleic acid test (NAT), is not available in majority of the blood banks in the state.Currently, ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test as well as manual screening is carried out in majority of blood banks in the state, but these test have their limitations.“For ELISA test to detect HIV, the virus should have been active for at least 40 days before the test. Also, the manual testing method (for ELISA third generation) has the possibility of the virus not getting detected at all due to human error. Though NAT is the safest (can detect the virus if it has been in the body for seven days), it is a costly affair,” T Vishnu Vardhan, chief executive officer, NTR Trust Blood Bank , said.Of 136 blood banks in the city, 43 facilities, including state-run blood banks, were being supported by National Aids Control Organization (NACO). And, less than five actually conduct NAT. NACO currently supplies the third generation manual ELISA kit to supported blood banks. “The ELISA test is followed by almost all government as well as private sector blood banks. While one possibility is that the basic antibody test that we are doing does not detect HIV as the antibody has not yet been developed, the possibility of erroneous blood banks, negligence and a small possibility of re-use of syringes cannot be ruled out,” Dr V Rajasekhar, project director, TSACS, said. “So far, no incident of blood banks totally avoiding blood screening has come to our notice,” he added.Also, once blood banks discover that a patient was HIV positive, they should inform, counsel and inform the TSACS and send the patient to the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) in the district. “Usually, the blood banks do not take it to the logical end when they find a patient is positive, they tend to wash their hands off,” say insiders.","['jabs', 'jaws', '100', 'banks', 'push', 'syringe', 'blood', 'test', 'possibility', 'dialysis', 'screening', 'transfusion', 'death', 'syringes', 'infected', 'virus', 'elisa', 'hiv']","Also, the fact that blood transfusion standards are not maintained as many private blood banks have mushroomed.

Patients in Maharashtra too have, over the years, claimed to have contracted HIV through infected needles or syringes.An RTI response from National Aids Control Society (NACO) showed that over 500 people in the state have got HIV through infected needles. Between 2012-13 and 2016-17, 512 disclosed at Integrated Centres for Testing and Counselling (ICTCs) that exposure to infected needle was responsible for the infection, said RTI activist Chetan Kothari. Numbers suggest an average 70-200 people get HIV through infected needles every year. In 2017-18, 69 people, including 29 women, contracted the infection.But the numbers have been highly debated by state agencies working towards controlling the disease. Parimal Sinh, who heads the state Aids control society, said less than 0.5% of new infections are due to infected needles. Over 90% of the infection in the state happens through the heterosexual route.“More importantly, the needle-infection numbers are based on voluntary disclosures made by people during counselling sessions before and after they are tested for HIV in ICTCs. Often, patients tend to suggest blood transfusion and infection through needles as possible mode of transmission. While our counsellors try to find out the exact reason, we also have to keep in mind the mental state of the patient.”Medically too, a single needle usage may not necessarily mean transmission of HIV. Eldred Tellis of Sankalp Rehabilitation Trust, that has been working with intravenous drug users (IDUs), said the virus could survive for three hours in the bore of a needle as there is vacuum, but otherwise it would die within 10 seconds. “But since HIV is a weak virus, the viral load of the infected person has to be really high for transmission. Studies suggest that one in 10 persons will get HIV if the needle is infected.”Interestingly, the highest HIV prevalence (7%) in the country is among IDUs, who use addictive substances through injections by exchanging needles. “In most cases, they pull out blood and put it back in the syringe to extract maximum of the drug and inject into veins contributing to high HIV infection,” he said. Tellis added that the authorities must also think of hepatitis C infection as that transmits more efficiently than HIV. “In Mumbai IDUs, hepatitis prevalence is around 35%, whereas HIV is 9.5%,” he said.","['infection', 'idus', 'contracted', 'suggest', '500', 'needle', 'state', 'patients', 'needles', 'transmission', 'rti', 'numbers', 'maharashtra', 'infected', 'hiv']","MUMBAI: Transmission of HIV through infected needles doesn’t seem to be restricted to villages in Uttar Pradesh alone.

An FIR is being registered against three quacks while notices are being served to 44 others, who have been unable to produce degrees or relevant documents for running clinics,” Unnao chief medical officer (CMO) Dr S P Chowdhary told TOI on Saturday.“If ‘doctors’ are not registered with the Medical Council of India, they have no right to practice medicine. We are taking action on complaints of quackery,” the CMO added.An official spokesman said while some of these quacks were operating from their houses, others had opened clinics.“Officials have been asked to verify the credentials of the quacks who run advertisements on local TV channels in the district. The health department teams will also request cable operators to stop advertisements promoting tantriks and quacks,” he added.Meanwhile, HIV affected people of the three villagers of Bangarmau — Prem Ganj, Chakmir and Kirmidiyapur — have demanded setting up of an antiretroviral therapy (ART) link centre at Bangarmau community health centre (CHC) to facilitate cheap and affordable treatment.At present, patients are being treated at the ART centre of Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial (GSVM) medical college in Kanpur. ART is a therapy that improves the life quality of HIV patients with treatment that maximally suppresses the HIV virus.“My 10-year-old daughter is HIV positive,” said Vinay (name changed), describing how his entire family makes a three-hour-long journey from Premganj where they live to the medical college in Kanpur every month.“My daughter depends on antiretroviral therapy given at the ART centre to keep living. We can’t afford the fare any longer. It would be better if the authorities establish a link centre at Bangarmau CHC itself,” said Vinay.His views were echoed by Sudarshan (name changed), a truck driver and a father of a 12-year-old HIV positive son. Residents of Chakmir, Sudarshan and his wife travel to Kanpur every month for treatment of their son and the bus ride costs Rs 800 per trip.“The amount spent on travelling to the nearest ART centre should be reimbursed. Moreover, the government should set up a link centre here, else I would have no option but to skip treatment,” he said.Local social activists said what is worrying is that of the total 58 HIV positive cases identified so far during screening in the three villages, only 25 have visited the ART centre.“ART treatment can’t cure HIV/AIDS . There is still no outright cure for the disease, and it does not go away by itself. But ARTs do slow down the damage that the virus does to the immune system, and allow people to live long, productive lives like everyone else, without succumbing to the disease,” said an activist.A senior health official at ART centre, meanwhile, said there were several reasons why patients avoid medication. “They usually do not want to reveal their condition to their near and dear ones. Many skip the treatment out of the fear that others will find out about their condition,” he said.At least 58 persons tested positive for HIV in Bangarmau after a quack allegedly used infected syringes to treat scores of his patients. Of these, 33 were detected at a blood donation camp on February 3 while 25 had come to light last year.","['affected', 'centre', 'treatment', 'bangarmau', 'clinics', 'health', 'quacks', '73', 'positive', 'patients', 'sealed', 'medical', 'art', 'hiv']","BANGARMAU: Health authorities have taken action against 73 quacks by sealing their clinics in various localities of Bangarmau tehsil in Unnao district following spread of HIV in three villages due to alleged treatment by a quack.“As many 73 clinics of alleged quacks have been sealed.

Of this, 42 are under the Chennai Corporation and four are monitored directly by Tamil Nadu AIDS Control Society (TANSACS).However, with HIV featuring bottom-most in the city health department’s priority list -- following a drop in prevalence over the years -- counsellors at various ICTCs complain that lab technicians in these centers are often deputed to other departments in Corporation hospitals. “Screening is often affected in the process,” said a counsellor. “Patients are either asked to wait or return later, but they rarely do as most of them are part of a floating population,” she said.The 42 ICTCs under corporation are managed by Chennai Corporation AIDS Prevention and Control Society ( CAPACS ), a body set up by National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) in the late 90s, along with similar city-wings in Mumbai and Ahmedabad. In 2016, NACO, following a decline in HIV prevalence in Ahmedabad and Chennai, wrote to the state AIDS control societies in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu asking them to merge the city-specific operations with the state.A senior official in TANSACS said of the Rs 69 crore the state receives every year from NACO, at least Rs 6.9 crore goes for paying salaries of around 100 CAPACS staff. “The department is cash-strapped right now with NACO slashing funds. CAPACS is an additional burden,” he said.Besides, financial difficulties, officials say the merger will also benefit HIV patients. “Besides helping us monitor these centres better, we can also fill the vacancies by deputing staff from ICTCs in other districts where the prevalence is low,” he said. Another official said the city AIDS control society was set up at a time when these centers were available only in Chennai. “Now we have sufficient testing centers in the districts. The body is now obsolete,” he said.At present, there are 1,264 ICTCs and 55 antiretroviral therapy centers for HIV/AIDS people in Tamil Nadu.

The state has a current prevalence rate of 0.28%, just above the national rate of 0.27%.Chennai Corporation officials said they are preparing a proposal for the merger which will be placed before CAPACS’s general body.

Of them, 48 have died while the remaining are on anti-retroviral therapy. The village, barely 18km from a government hospital, was home to around 500 families at that time. At least one member from each was working in Maharashtra or Gujarat. With migrant population believed to be a major reason for the virus, HIV came to be known as ‘Mumbai wali bimari’ here.Today, 90% of the 700 houses in the village have someone working in Maharashtra but no new case has been reported in the past five years.Women have driven the change by openly talking about prevention, claim health activists and officials. Caution has become their second nature.“Women maketheir husbands get themselves tested for HIV at least once a year,” said Vidya Devi, who was a newly wed in 2005. Anganwadi worker Gyan Swaroopa has been a hero of HIV prevention by counselling the women. Breaking barriers of shame and harassment—there is fear of being teased by men for talkingabout sex—she speaks openly to every boy who heads to Mumbai. “Isme kahekisharam... jaan hai to jahan hai (Why be ashamed of doing my duty. Health and survival are the most important),” she reasons.As a result, the air of stigma around HIV is absent in this village.“You can pose direct questions on HIV here unlike in other villages. In fact, HIV testing is considered even at the onset of a simplefever,” saidRajendra Sahu of Nehru Yuva Sangathan Tisi, a social organisation working to create awareness around HIV/ AIDS. Village head Jagatpal said: “The men have been told to have sex only with their wives. The elders keep an eye on the behaviour of their children.

The data further reveals that in the age group of 15-54, the number increased to 0.24%.The officials said that in the 15-24 years group, prevalence was more than any other age group. Interestingly, in this age group, no female was found to be HIV positive. The data also reveals that these are the percentage of HIV positive women and men tested by groups of states or Union territories.The data further reveals that of the 0.48% married couples who are HIV positive only 0.04% were couples where both spouses were HIV positive. The data further revealed that 0.22% men were HIV positive with their wives being HIV negative. Similarly, in 0.22% it was the wife who was HIV positive while the husband was not HIV positive.The survey also brought to light the failure of the government to create awareness about HIV. According to the data released, only 69% of men and 43% of women were aware that use of condoms during sex can prevent HIV. Among men, Gujarat ranked 10 from the bottom when it came to knowledge of condoms and women were the fourth worst, better only than Bihar, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Nagaland.The data reveals the awareness of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV/AIDS was very poor in Gujarat among women, Dadra and Nagar Haveli has the lowest awareness (16%) of MTCT, followed by Bihar (33%) and Gujarat (34%).The data further reveals that only 59% women were aware of HIV, while among 77% men had awareness about HIV.

The second strongest mode for HIV transmission is blood transfusion. It also cannot be denied that many couples only use condom for family planning and are unaware that it can be used to prevent HIV. Oza further said that HIV awareness has to be increased, but it is a time-consuming process and while there has been an improvement, it is less than expected.","['reveals', '1524', 'women', 'gujarat', 'group', 'men', 'age', 'prevalent', 'positive', 'awareness', 'data', 'hiv']","AHMEDABAD: Data released by the National Family Health Survey reveals that the 0.30% of males in the age group of 15-24 were found to be HIV positive.

But their HIV-positive status has turned them into social pariahs, with the city offering them no space to pursue their entrepreneurial dreams.Out to open their own café called “Cafe Positive”, all they have met with for the last three months is a big negative. No house-owner in some of south Kolkata’s posh localities has been willing to rent out space once told about “who will manage and run the shop”.While a few landlords have straightaway refused saying “e paray erom cholbena (such business won’t run in this neighbourhood)”, others have been courteous enough with financial help and old clothes, but pleaded helplessness in renting out space to the 18-plus teens.The NGO funding the café and trying to find a 750sqft space has approached over a dozen owners since December at locations like Golpark, Dover Lane, Lake Road , Hindustan Park and Purna Das Road. “We have been looking for a suitable space for the café since December and approached a number of house-owners directly and through brokers. The owners initially seemed excited at the concept, but the moment they learnt that the shop will be managed and run solely by HIV-positive children, they backed out,” said Kallol Ghosh , founder of Anandaghar, a shelter for abandoned HIV/AIDS-infected children.TOI spoke to two house-owners, one at Lake Road and the other at Dover Lane. “I would not mind renting out space to them. But we live in a joint family and some members have objections. I could not convince them, so I rejected the offer,” said a landlady.The house-owner at Dover Lane, too, blamed her neighbours and family. “I don’t know how people in our neighbourhood would react to it. I know there are many misconceptions associated with HIV . I don’t think I am in a position to convince everyone. Moreover, I have now decided to rent the space to a boutique and not an eatery,” he said.The Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (Prevention and Control) Bill, 2017 defines what can count as discrimination against HIV-positive people. It lists that denial or discontinuation of employment, education, healthcare services, renting or residing property, standing for public or private office will count as discrimination along with unfair treatment in any of the above mentioned categories.The shelter at Narendrapur is home to around 70-odd young patients and this café project is part of an initiative to make a group self-sufficient. The NGO will give the initial funds and later hand over the management of the café to the 10 boys and girls, who would be running it.“We have been undergoing training at this shelter and can’t wait to start our café. We know the disease we suffer from and how it spreads or what precautions we need to take. But strangely, the adults don’t understand that HIV doesn’t spread through touch and often hesitate to even shake hands with us,” said Susanta Pal (name changed), a Class XII student who was diagnosed with HIV when he was just 5.“HIV does not spread by kissing, hugging, sharing food/drink, toilet seats, sweat, touching, sneeze/cough or through insect bites. We also want society to know about these from our café. But for that, we first need an opportunity,” said Sathi Biswas (name changed), another Class XII student who specialises in sandwich-making and baking cookies.According to the plan, food and beverages at the 750sqft ground-floor café will be served on disposable plates and there will be no sharp cutleries or glass items that can cause bleeding. “We are not looking for any exceptions or rebate and are ready to pay as per the existing market rate but even then not a single house-owner is ready,” lamented Ghosh.","['space', 'lane', 'dream', 'house', 'hits', 'café', 'shelter', 'road', 'run', 'kolkata', 'hurdle', 'know', 'renting', 'houseowner', 'hivpositive', 'hiv']","KOLKATA: They are a bunch of 10 ordinary teenagers, who nourish the dream of making it big.

With a mission to change peoples’ perception about HIV/AIDS, she got herself involved in social activities for HIV community. At present, she is the face of HIV community in the country.Meet Daxa Patel , who is not only president of National Coalition of People Living with HIV in India (NCPI+), but also relentlessly working for patients, most of them outcast by the society. From organizing awareness camps to marriage fairs for HIV patients and successfully running a day-boarding school and hostel for HIV-infected children, Daxa has put her life, blood and sweat for their uplift.“When my husband and I were diagnosed with HIV in 1997, there was no treatment available. Meanwhile, I got pregnant and had no choice but to go for termination. One of the doctors told me that my lifespan was just for five months. I was searching for a person infected with HIV and I found a woman who was living with the disease for two years. This gave me confidence that I could also live long. This was the turning point in my life,” says 42-year-old Daxa.Daxa, who was doing a small embroidery business from her house, and her husband informed their family and relatives about the disease. To their surprise, the family was very supportive and this further boosted her confidence on fighting discrimination faced by people like her. Her treatment began only in 2007, 10 years after he was infected.It was in 2003, Daxa, who was earlier working as a counsellor with a city-based non-governmental organization SAHAS, got in touch with Umesh Patel. Along with Umesh and other few community members, they decided to launch a platform for HIV positive people. This is how the Gujarat State Network for People Living with HIV/ÁID (GSNP+) was launched in 2003.The main objective of GSNP+ was to assist the people infected with HIV/AIDS, ensure they get proper medical attention and timely medicines and organizing awareness programmes etc.“We used to meet the HIV patients at some deserted places and gardens to protect their identity. We started with just 35 members at GSNP+ and now we have 67,000 members across all the districts in Gujarat,” she said.Later, the NCPI+ was launched at the national level and the organization has a presence in 32 states across the country. Daxa is also running Janani Dham for the destitute HIV and AIDS infected orphaned children on the outskirts of the city since 2009. It is supported by Gujarat government’s social justice department and Surat-based P P Savani Group and has around 98 boys and girls.GSNP+ will soon launch a scheme for HIV positive people, where they can get easy medicine refill and won’t have to visit government dispensaries.

While none of her in-laws came to take her back, her husband died of AIDS in January 2018.

It is under the ‘Viral load testing for all people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV)’ initiative launched by the Union ministry of health and family welfare on February 26 this year.The ART centres selected in Bihar are at Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) Patna and Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH), Muzaffarpur.Total 530 ART centres have been selected for free viral load testing of 12 lakh PLHIV on treatment in the country at least once a year.The central government has tied up with a private laboratory in Mumbai under public-private partnership (PPP) mode to provide viral load testing facility to patients across the country. A senior state health department official said samples would be collected from the three ART centres and flown to the Mumbai laboratory for test. “A hard copy of the report will be sent to the state,” he said.Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) targets and destroys CD4 T cells that strengthen immunity in a person. Patients with a CD4 count below 200 are susceptible to develop serious illnesses. Viral load testing essentially tells whether the ART treatment regimen is working or not by measuring the amount of virus in a patient’s blood.“In more than 95% cases, the viral load becomes undetectable after six months of ART treatment. Earlier, the only test conducted to measure the effectiveness of treatment was to check the immune level (CD4 test) in a patient. Sometimes, the patient also becomes drug-resistant after treatment and thus the viral load increases. With viral load testing in government ART centres, it will be possible to detect the increase of the viruses in the blood of the patient after treatment,” a member of International AIDS Society, Dr Diwakar Tejaswi, said.There are only three private labs in Patna for collecting samples for viral load testing and they charge approximately Rs4000- 4500 for one test.","['treatment', 'test', 'load', 'free', 'antiretroviral', 'testing', '19', 'centres', 'patients', 'patna', 'patient', 'viral', 'therapy', 'art', 'hiv']","PATNA: Three antiretroviral therapy (ART) centres in Bihar will carry out viral load testing for HIV/AIDS from April 19.

She is Meena Vij, who lost her husband to AIDS in 2004.She was in her second pregnancy in 1994 when she learnt she was HIV +ve. She aborted the child and confronted her husband, who ran a hotel. “After initial hesitance, he accepted his relationships with multiple partners,” said Meena, whose son is 27 now, and HIV negative.There was no ‘happily ever after’ in Meena’s life with her husband, but today she helps the people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Chandigarh find love. She has married off eight of them. Her face lights up at announcing that barring one, the rest of the couples are proud parents of HIV-negative children. “Of the myths about the disease, one is that the babies born to a mother with HIV also test positive,” Meena said. “People are unaware that if the mother and her baby receive proper medication during pregnancy and after birth, the chances of it are very less.”Meena is a member of the Chandigarh Network of People living with HIV/AIDS, or CNP+ for short. She is also a peer counsellor of Vihaan, a CNP+ programme. Network’s president Pooja Thakur was shunned by her in-laws when she tested positive along with her two sons a decade ago. Her eldest son, however, is HIV negative. Her husband died of AIDS. Pooja dared to go public about her HIV status in order to work for HIV awareness and counselling.Her positive attitude towards life rubbed on to several women and gave them the courage to live. One of them is today a member of Chandigarh State AIDS Control Society (SACS), CNP+, and Vihaan. She joined the network in 2007 after losing her husband to AIDS. She could move to Chandigarh with her four children because of a supportive brother.Created in November 2005, CNP+ meets on the 25th of every month, for tasks such as introducing new members, following up on the missed cases, and linking the members with ART centres. Today, the network has 1,000-plus registered members, who pay an annual subscription of Rs 100.CNP+ and Vihaan participate in many programmes of the state society. “We tell the PLHIV to visit the 12 integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTCs) in Chandigarh for free testing. We ask people to practice safe sex,” said Rahul, HIV+ve for more than 10 years.Meena said: “More important than fighting the disease is to fight the social stigma that keeps people from sharing their HIV status with family and taking treatment. We share our life stories with these people to boost their morale. We are living examples that with proper medication and diet, one can live with this virus for years,” said Meena, HIV +ve for 24 years.The PLHIVs live as outcasts. Family and friends discriminate against them, while even doctors judge them. Pooja asked for countrywide order for the doctors and clerks to write “universal precaution” instead of “HIV positive” on their hospital cards, “so that the chemists don’t look at us differently when they see the stamp”.“If our identity is revealed, our children won’t get admission in schools,” said a member of the network, seeking government support for a home for HIV-positive children and a higher monthly pension for widows and children from the present Rs 1,000 and Rs 700, respectively. Ask Pooja about the free bus pass in Chandigarh for PLHIVs and she has a hearty laugh. “For seven years, no progress,” she said.","['aids', 'attitude', 'meena', 'husband', 'chandigarh', 'positive', 'children', 'network', 'cnp', 'pooja', 'hiv']","She is Meena Vij, who lost her husband to AIDS in 2004.She was in her second pregnancy in 1994 when she learnt she was HIV +ve.

Dr Sreelatha P R, pediatrics department, MCH said that the girl died of leukemia. “She was admitted to the hospital on Wednesday and her condition was very serious,” the doctor said.The girl’s father said she was taken to the RCC after the doctors at the MCH diagnosed her with leukemia in February, 2017. The treatment for leukemia began on March 1, 2017. While she was under treatment at RCC the girl underwent blood transfusion several times. The girl was tested positive for HIV in August, 2017. “On October 5, our child was taken to a lab in Chennai for a detailed HIV test. However, the lab report said she was not HIV positive. The doctors at RCC said it was not a final report and they can confirm the presence of HIV only after getting a report from Delhi. But the doctors have not given that report us till date,” he said.The girl’s father said she was discharged from the RCC on November 1last year. “After that she was never taken to the RCC. We followed ayurveda treatment. But it did not work her. She was under the treatment of doctors at Alappuzha MCH. On Wednesday, her condition became serious and we took her to the MCH. But she died,'' he said. The funeral will be held on Thursday.Dr Ramesh R, project director of the Kerala State AIDS Control Society ( KSACS ), said the blood samples of the girl were tested in the lab of General Hospital, Tambaram in Chennai but the lab could not find viral load in her blood samples. “We forwarded the report to National AIDS Control Organization ( NACO ). They did not advice treatment for HIV as the Chennai lab could not find viral load. We were planning to conduct a repeat HIV test on her in CMC Vellore after some months,'' he said.The Medical College police in Thiruvananthapuram in September 2017 had registered case and launched a probe after receiving a complaint from the girl's parents in this regard.

While the number remains a concern for officials, what is worrying them even more is that they could not establish the source of the disease in 32 children, an increase of 10. This has led officials to believe that more children are engaging in highrisk sexual behavior or are victims of abuse.In 2015, of the 311 children who tested positive for HIV/ AIDS in the state, 289 contracted the infection from their HIV-infected mothers during pregnancy, labour or breastfeeding. Officials couldn’t establish the source of the infection in 22 children. Two years later, the number of parent-to-child transmission dipped along with the number of new cases detected among children, but the number of unaccounted cases touched 32, show data furnished by Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society in response to an RTI application by TOI.Officials and doctors say they suspect the mode of transmission of the infection among these children to be sexual as the increase is corroborated by an uptick in the number of children referred to government-run clinics for sexually transmitted infections. The number went up from 6,234 in 2015 to 8,871last year.Recognising the growing prevalence of STIs among children, TANSACS project director K Senthil Raj said he is in talks with the school education secretary to dedicate more space to sex education in the soon-to-be-introduced revamped textbooks.He said staff at the integrated counselling and testing centers (ICTC) for HIV usually maintain a record of children with the infection, including those who haven’t got it from infected mothers. “They usually don’t probe. But if they do find the reason during the counselling, they maintain it in their notebooks,” he said. Some of the children, he said, could have acquired it through blood transfusion or injectable drugs.Consultant psychiatrist Dr M Suresh Kumar, who has worked extensively with injection drug users, rules out this possibility. “Heroin and other synthetic injectable opioids were popular till the late 90s. We haven’t been seeing young heroin addicts in a while,” saidDr Kumar.Hisobservation is backed by official data: Of the 1.43 lakh people living withHIVin TNcovered under the central-sponsored prevention programme, 56 are users of injectibles. All are in their 40s and above. Dr Kumar saidthey are,however, seeing other kinds of addictions, including marijuana and alcohol,on the rise among youngsters. “It is known that high drug use can make you vulnerable to engaging in high-risksexualbehavior,” he noted.HIV specialist Dr S Sundar observed that the state should expand its HIV/AIDS prevention programme to youngsters who aren’t part of the traditional “high-risk” group. “All our programmes are targeted at the high-risk population like female sex workers, transgenders, men who have sex with men and truck drivers. But ask a counsellor at an ICTC who he or sheseesthe most–itisusually people who are not part of this group,” hesaid. “Children are engaging in sexual activity belowthelegal ageof consent. It is a fact. They could be in a situation where nobody will even ask for consent,” added Sundar.Whatever be the source, once diagnosed, these children are forced to battle the stigma associated with the infection or live in the fear that someone may find out they are positive, said P Manorama, former chairperson of Child Welfare Committee, Chennai, who runs an organisation that works with children withHIV. Shesaidshe receives at least one child trafficking victim a year who tests positivefor HIVlinkedto sexualexploitation. “Butthey remain mere names in the state’s medical records.

In past several years, only three to five units of HIV infected blood units had been timely detected annually.The rise implies that the number of HIV infected persons are increasing, and also that KGMU has been able to detect infected blood with much more precision by using the specialized Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT), than the previously used ELISA testing method to check donated blood for preventing infections via blood transfusion. Speaking at a programme on ‘Safe Blood Transfusion: Need of the Hour’, head of transfusion medicine department at KGMU, Prof Tulika Chandra said, “Blood transfusion runs a direct risk of contracting HIV if the blood is infected. We at KGMU have undertaken NAT since 2012. Since then, of the 3,10,000 units tested by NAT, 2,300 were found to be infected with HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C and were thus discarded.”But, it is not just 2,300 lives, that KGMU claims to have saved, depending on just conducting NAT on blood. “NAT helped save more than 9,000 lives by detecting 2,300 infected blood units that were discarded since four blood components would have been segregated from each unit, which equals to four patients and any one of this unit can be infected,” said Prof Chandra.She added that the number of HIV infected blood units has grown exponentially while cases of blood infected with Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B have gone down over the years.“There is an urgent need for blood transfusions to be made safe and the government should take note of this fact. Infected blood can be fatal if transfused to an ailing person. There is a phenomena called horizontal transfusion, which means that a person, transfused with infected blood, can give the infection to others in family through sexual and sometimes other means,” she added.Prof Chandra added that KGMU and SGPGIMS are the only centres using NAT while other government hospitals are still using the ELISA testing method.ELISA detects antibodies or antigens produced months after an infection is contracted and is thus futile for recent infections. NAT on the other hand, directly detects DNA or RNA of the infection causing virus present in the blood, making it more accurate.","['hivinfected', 'hepatitis', 'blood', 'kgmu', '11', 'testing', 'units', 'nat', 'transfusion', 'using', '17', 'infected', 'hiv']","LUCKNOW:In 2017, as many as 11units of blood donated at the community blood bank of King George’s Medical University ( KGMU ) were found to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

While 27 HIV-positive people died in Mumbai in 2015-16, the number rose to 72 in 2016-17 and further to 116 in 2017-18, showed the data.“There has been a 62% increase in deaths due to the HIV/ AIDS epidemic in the last one year alone,” said RTI activist Chetan Kothari, who compiled the data. Between 2015 and 2016, the deaths rose by 166%.The HIV/AIDS epidemic, that had peaked in the nineties, has become manageable due to availability of medicines called antiretroviral treatment (ART); a fatal disease was soon transformed into achronic condition manageable with drugs. Number of deaths fell as a result even as the number of fresh HIV infections began to show a decline in the last few years.In this backdrop, the sudden spurt in deaths is worrisome, said doctors. A senior doctor, who didn’t want to be identified, said, “Deaths occur in poor patients in whom the current mode of treatment has failed.” Patients for whom the first line of ART no longer worked due to years of use, needed second- or third-line drugs.“However, these new medicines are expensive and not easily available in the governmentrun programme. The poor cannot afford to buy them,” the doctor added. However, city authorities in charge of the HIV/AIDS control programme said there is a simple explanation for the increase: A sharper public health programme that has managed to track more patients.Dr Shrikala Acharya of the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) said the organization had carried out intensive loss-to-follow-up drives as per central government directives to track patients who were lost to follow-up. “This drive helped us update the actual number of deaths. It could also be the reason for the increase in reported deaths,” she said, adding that the rise isn’t necessarily an actual increase in the number of deaths.Incidentally, the HMIS data shows that the number of AIDS deaths has been steadily decreasing across Maharashtra. From 1,426 deaths in 2015-16, the figure fell to 1,390 in the following year and further to 1,327 in 2017-18.

This is a significant improvement from a decade ago, when over two HIV+ cases were recorded per day.While men constituted 60% of the total number of HIV+ cases in the first trimester of this year, no transgenders and transsexuals were detected with the condition for the second year in a row.Mormugao continued to be the taluka with the highest number of HIV+ cases (27%), while Salcete came in second at 16%.

No new cases were reported from Sattari, Sanguem and Canacona.The predominant mode of transmission of HIV has continued to be the sexual route, with over 90% of such cases reported. Transmission modes involving infected syringes, needles, blood and blood products have been negligible in the state.Although five deaths due to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) were reported in January and February this year, chief medical officer of the Goa State AIDS Control Society (GSACS), Dr Chandrakant Parab, said the launch of the ‘test and treat’ policy last April is expected to reduce the number of AIDS-related deaths further.

In the past, ART, which suppresses the activity of the HIV retrovirus, was recommended only in cases where it was considered necessary.Since the implementation of the ‘test and treat’ policy, more than 370 HIV+ persons have been put on ART in a phased manner in the state.“ART, which can slow down the rate at which HIV weakens the immune system, is now administered to everybody: Men, women, adolescents and children,” Parab said, pointing out that the move is expected to keep their immune system strong and healthy and improve their longevity and quality of life.Parab said the elimination of stigma is vital to ensure that people who have the slightest doubt of their status voluntarily come forward to get tested and seek treatment. “Those indulging in risky behaviour must also protect themselves, as HIV is 100% preventable,” he added.","['system', 'trimester', '2018s', 'immune', 'person', 'policy', 'treat', 'cases', 'detected', 'number', 'transmission', 'reported', 'day', 'art', 'hiv']","PANAJI: Ninety-two people tested positive for the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) in Goa in the first three months of 2018, translating into one case being detected each day.

KOLKATA: Cafe Positive, a dream of 10 HIV-positive teenagers, has finally found an address.The 12ft-by-10ft garage at Jodhpur Park was finalised after a six-month search for space in some of south Kolkata’s posh localities yielded a straightaway “no” from house-owners when they learnt about who will manage and run the shop.At 524 Jodhpur Park, a senior official of a leading national ayurvedic firm and an honorary member of Rotary Club of Calcutta has offered his garage space to the teenagers from where they plan to start the café in July. “I was initially a bit hesitant to offer my garage space as it is much smaller than what they were looking for. But after learning that they had failed to manage any space in over six months, I told them to start their business from here. This can be the beginning from where they can spread their wings. I am happy to be a part of this noble initiative,” said Indrajyoti Dasgupta.Dasgupta, who has moved his car out of the garage for the café, is yet to find an alternate parking space.TOI had reported on March 5 how six boys and four girls, who have undergone training in baking, sandwich-making and coffee and mocktail preparations, aspired to start their own coffee shop at some location in south Kolkata but were turned down by house-owners.“We faced strange reasons from people for refusing space to these kids. While some said their family members were not ready, others said people in the neighbourhood wouldn’t allow them to run a business with HIV-positive patients. But we are thankful to have finally found space. It is a much smaller space than what we were looking for, but at least the kids can start from here,” said Kallol Ghosh, founder of Anandaghar, a shelter for abandoned HIV/AIDS-infected children at Narendrapur.N GO Anandaghar will give the initial funds and later hand over the management of the café to the 10 youths, who would be running it.The café is scheduled to start from July 14, coinciding with Rath Yatra. “We will begin with an assortment of hot and cold coffees, mocktails and mojitos, and at least four types of cakes, veg and non-veg sandwiches and cookies. For now, we will bank more on takeaway service till we get a bigger place with a larger seating capacity,” said Susanta Pal (name changed), one of the 10 youths.“It has been a long wait. At one time, we thought we would never get space for our shop after being rejected by several house-owners.

We will be able to wipe off the taboos associated with the disease we suffer from with day-to-day interaction with our customers,” said Sathi Biswas (name changed), another member.","['space', 'garage', 'signals', 'finally', 'start', 'dream', 'café', 'teenagers', 'looking', 'smaller', 'househunt', 'south', 'kids', 'end', 'hiv']","Congratulations are in order for the property owners who have risen above such evidently widespread — but completely unfounded — prejudice.

The pellets, that can be sprinkled over food too, have already proven to be advantageous, in terms of administration. The syrup , which used to be the main alternative for paediatric patients, was met with a lot of resistance as it left a bitter aftertaste and children would often spit it out.The centre at Sion hospital will be documenting the efficacy and acceptance of the oral pellets, along with the other centres. “So far, the response has been positive. Earlier, parents would return with the syrup bottles and say it was unpalatable,” said Dr Yashwant Gabhale, head of the paediatric centre at Sion. Additionally, a decrease in side-effects has also been seen. “Problems such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been minimal, so far,” he added.There are nearly 76,000 children living with HIV in the country of which 5,000-odd are from Maharashtra. The use of oral pellets has been restricted to children up to two years of age for now. While the national programme incorporated children since 2006, it was only by late 2007 that paediatric formulations were available. Former paediatric head of Sion hospital Dr Mamata Manglani said that children were initially given adult medication till syrups came into the national programme. “However, there were logistical and storage issues with syrups that paved the way for dispensable tablets over time,” she said.Finding pharmaceutical companies to make child-friendly formulations has always been a challenge, say NACO experts, who hope to scale up once the paediatric centres present their feedback and there are more suppliers. “Currently, Cipla is the only company that is making oral pellet formulation. Mylan is likely to start producing it next,” said NACO’s Dr RS Gupta. He said the introduction of pellets is likely to make a big difference in adherence. “Gulping pills every day is a struggle in itself. It becomes more difficult for babies,” he said. Doctors say the overall adherence among children is more than 90%, till their parents are giving them the medicines.A parent TOI spoke to said oral pellets are undoubtedly easy to administer. “We only hope that it is regularly available and the supply is uninterrupted since there are limited manufacturers,” he said. Not too long ago, the syrup was in short supply across the country.","['hospital', 'say', 'hiv', 'syrup', 'dr', 'pellets', 'paediatric', 'national', 'kids', 'children', 'palatable', 'sion', 'oral']","The pellets, that can be sprinkled over food too, have already proven to be advantageous, in terms of administration.

It also noted that the epidemics were expanding in Pakistan and the Philippines.In India, new HIV infections dropped from 120,000 in 2010 to 88,000 in 2017, AIDS-related deaths from 160,000 to 69,000 and people living with HIV from 2,300,000 to 2,100,000 in the same time period, the report said.India has an approved social protection strategy, policy or framework that is being implemented, it said.Successive surveys in Cambodia, India, Thailand and Vietnam also indicate that attitudes towards people living with HIV have improved creating safer working conditions for sex workers and engaging them closely in the design and implementation of programmes make a huge difference, it said.The report underscored the public health benefits of decriminalising sex work.It found that countries that had decriminalised at least some aspects of sex work have fewer sex workers living with HIV than countries that criminalise all aspects of sex work.Modelling based on data from Canada, India and Kenya indicates that the decriminalisation of sex work could avert 33-46 per cent of HIV infections over the course of a decade.The report cited the example of Karnataka, where advocacy work with senior police officials, sensitisation workshops and the inclusion of HIV and human rights topics in pre-service curricula led to significant decreases in the arrest of female sex workers, especially during police raids.Before the interventions, half (50 per cent) of the 4,110 surveyed female sex workers said they had been arrested or detained at some point during police raids, that proportion shrank to 20 per cent after the interventions, the report said.Referring to the initiative sponsored by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to reduce the spread of HIV in India, the report said the Avahan programme in Karnataka and other States remained a ""sterling example"" of the impact of combining condom programming with community empowerment and structural improvements that tackle stigma, violence and unsafe working environments.UNAIDS, however, issued a stark wake-up call for nations, warning that the global response to HIV is at a precarious point.At the halfway point to the 2020 targets, the report warned that the pace of progress was not matching global ambition.""We are sounding the alarm"", said Michel Sidibe, Executive Director of UNAIDS.""Entire regions are falling behind, the huge gains we made for children are not being sustained, women are still most affected, resources are still not matching political commitments and key populations continue to be ignored. All these elements are halting progress and urgently need to be addressed head-on,"" Sidibe said.Global new HIV infections have declined by just 18 per cent in the past seven years, from 2.2 million in 2010 to 1.8 million in 2017, the report noted.Although this is nearly half the number of new infections compared to the peak in 1996 (3.4 million), the decline is not quick enough to reach the target of fewer than 500,000 by 2020.In 2017, an estimated 36.9 million people globally were living with HIV and 21.7 million people were accessing treatment, it said.The report also shows that key populations are not being considered enough in HIV programming.Key populations and their sexual partners account for 47 per cent of the new HIV infections worldwide and 97 per cent of new HIV infections in eastern Europe and central Asia, where one third of new HIV infections are among people who inject drugs.""The right to health for all is non-negotiable,"" said Sidibe.""Sex workers, gay men and other men who have sex with men, prisoners, migrants, refugees and transgender people are more affected by HIV but are still being left out from HIV programmes.

She, however, didn’t become a victim of HIV . Fighting stigma, she groomed her self-confidence and started saving for her sons’ education. Today, her elder son, an MTech holder, works in Hyderabad, while her younger son is pursuing undergraduate engineering.Like Aishwarya, thousands of sex workers and sexual minorities have successfully kept HIV at bay and changed their lives drastically, thanks to project Avahan . The initiative focuses on integrating biological and behavioural aspects of target groups and empowering them with peer education.Avahan has been described as a “sterling example” in the recent report released by the joint UN Agency on AIDS ( UNAIDS ). Between 2003-12, the project, funded by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and University of Manitoba in Canada, reached out to 65,000 sex workers and over 25,000 sexual minorities. As per a survey, the findings of which were reported in British Medical Journal, the prevalence of HIV in Karnataka reduced from 19.6% to 10.8% and of syphilis (another sexually transmitted disease ) from 5.9% to 2.4%, with the increased use of condoms. Avahan, which targeted 16 districts of Karnataka, was credited for the achievement.“We got an identity. We ensured that we protected ourselves even while in the job. I am now into counselling and am leading a better life. I was able to save money for my children’s education,” said Aishwarya, who is no longer in sex work.What made Avahan a successful model was that it never took a moral and judgemental view, says H L Mohan, managing trustee, Karnataka Health Promotion Trust (KHPT), who spearheaded the project.According to a Lancet report, Avahan prevented no less than six lakh HIV cases in India. Karnataka was one of the six states chosen for the project, and here, it was executed by KHPT from 2003 to 2012.The programme not only brought in mandatory condom usage but also worked for the community members’ empowerment. Clinics were set up where members went for fortnightly tests. The project also helped them save money in cooperative societies run by themselves. Drop-in centres were established at the hotspots, where sex workers could walk in at any time to relax, watch TV and consult doctors. In Bengaluru, the centres were set up in Yeshwantpur, Shivajinagar and Malleswaram and were functional 24/7.With every fortnightly visit, members of the vulnerable section understood the complexity of the situation they were in. “We set up cooperative societies run by sex workers, so that they can save money and don’t have to borrow from money lenders. We have even saved many young girls from being trafficked,” said Mohan.In 2013, when the project ended, the centres were subsumed with the government. “Avahan should have been an ongoing project to make the state HIV-free,” added Mohan. Even now, KHPT gets visitors from abroad who come to study the model that led to HIV prevention.No mean featTo win the confidence of sex workers and work with them in risk-reduction interventions wasn’t easy to begin with. Usage of condoms alone wouldn’t have worked unless we reduced their vulnerability. We had to closely work with them to understand the strategy to safeguard them from infections. We did a hotspot mapping involving them. The strategy was different for each district. While home-based prostitution was seen more in districts like Shivamogga, street-based work was more prevalent in places like Davanagere, Ballari and BengaluruH L Mohan, managing trustee, KHPT","['sex', 'money', 'reduced', 'sterling', 'example', 'avahan', 'workers', 'karnatakas', 'karnataka', 'work', 'khpt', 'set', 'termed', 'project', 'burden', 'agency', 'hiv']","Today, her elder son, an MTech holder, works in Hyderabad, while her younger son is pursuing undergraduate engineering.Like Aishwarya, thousands of sex workers and sexual minorities have successfully kept HIV at bay and changed their lives drastically, thanks to project Avahan .

Every once a month, the person must seek leave from the workplace, arrive early in the morning to a hospital, beat the crowds and queue up for hours to collect the antiretroviral medicines.For a section of people living with HIV, this situation will soon change. In a first, the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) has decided to give patients the medicine stock for 90-days at a time. Currently, most patients are handed stocks for a month, and in rare instances, for two months. People living with HIV have long wanted this option, which has been tried with success in several African countries.Termed as Differentiated Service Delivery Model (DSDM), it has already been rolled out at ten centres across the country, including KEM Hospital in Parel. Patients, though, will have to meet several criteria to be eligible for DSDM. “Primarily, it will be given to those who have been on treatment for at least a year and have 95% adherence rate. The individual has to be clinically fit and free of any side-effects and opportunistic infections (such as tuberculosis) at the time of enrolment,” said Dr RS Gupta, deputy director, NACO. “Besides making it easier for patients, it will also help to decongest the ART centres,” he added.At KEM, over 500 patients have already been identified and enrolled into the programme. The Parel hospital caters to over 1500 people living with HIV. “Patients often have problems seeking frequent leaves from their workplace. This initiative will save them repeated visits only for drug refill. It will also save travel costs,” said Dr Srikala Acharya, assistant project director at the Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS). She added that only patients on the first line of treatment and CD4 count (a vital parameter) of more than 500 will be considered for DSDM.Besides Mumbai’s KEM, centres at Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Benaras, and designated hospitals in Manipur, Bhagalpur and Raipur are rolling out the initiative. Talking to TOI, a person living with HIV hailed the model and said it was long-awaited and will go a long way in making life easy for patients. “Most HIV-affected people continue to live in anonymity. It, therefore, becomes difficult to explain in offices why one needs to leave every month on fixed days,” said the 42-year-old central Mumbai resident.Members of the civil society too have welcomed the decision but cautioned that support systems have to be strengthened for the model to succeed. “It’s a great initiative particularly for patients who have to visit resource-strapped health facilities. In Mumbai, 17 ART centres cater to nearly 35000 patients. Decongestion of these centres will allow counsellors to spend more time with patients,” said HIV activist Ganesh Acharya. However, he said for DSDM to succeed, counselling facilities must be enhanced.Echoing the same, Sachin Awasthi from Vihaan, a patients’ group that works towards improving adherence, said that the monthly meeting with counsellors and caregivers play an important role. “We have to ensure that patients don’t start taking their regimes casually,” he said.","['hospital', 'relief', 'model', 'initiative', 'patients', 'mumbai', 'living', 'centres', 'kem', 'months', 'drugs', 'month', 'hiv']","MUMBAI: For people living with HIV , receiving medicines is as much of a challenge as keeping the virus in check.

This single insensitive act by the state’s premier hospital will only serve to dissuade others from seeking treatment.

Also, the state government must immediately see to it that all staffers of GMC, medical and otherwise, are apprised about the proper ethics to be followed in treating HIV patients and the consequences in case of failure to do so.

PANAJI: In a blatant violation of confidentiality over the status of an HIV positive patient, Goa Medical College on Tuesday afternoon affixed a ‘Universal Precaution’ board on the patient’s bed, causing much distress to the family besides casting stigma.The board invited curious stares and subjected the family to humiliating questions. No sooner they found out about the board, the patient’s children decided not to dare enter the ward for fear of being discriminated at the educational institutions where they study. Other members of the family were in tears trying to fend off unwanted questions.“The doctors, nurses, attendants and even those who bring food and clean the patient know about the health status. It is clearly written in all the papers appended in the treatment file too. I can’t understand why this board was put,” a close relative of the patient said.“The hospital should be helping such people who may not live for long. If they did not want us here, then they should have given us a special room or sent us away,” she said. The patient has been admitted at GMC in the past but this is the first time the family says such a board was affixed.“The staff did not think about the repercussions on the family. The ward sister was actually fixing the board near the patient’s head, but later put it at the foot of the bed. Were instructions given by the doctor to put the board? When the other patients ask the nurses about the board, won’t they reveal the health status?” she asked.“Even the few people who are coming to visit the patient will stop once they come to know about the health status. Neighbours are also coming to visit and are asking about the board. It’s a big shame for us. I’m going mad,” she said.The board was removed on Tuesday evening after a non-governmental organisation, Human Touch, working to end discrimination and provide care and support to people living with HIV raised the issue with the hospital authorities.Dean of Goa Medical College Dr Pradeep Naik said circulars were issued in the past asking the staff members to avoid any such terminology.“We have given strict instructions to all wards not to engage in any discriminatory behaviour against patients. From the preliminary report which I have received, it is not clear who put up the board. I have sought a detailed report by Wednesday. We will repeat the circular that we had issued earlier. This will never happen again,” he told TOI.“Universal precautions are necessary, but should not be displayed publicly on the patient’s bed,” CEO of Human Touch Foundation Peter Borges said.“This is not an isolated case. Such incidents will lead to more stigma and discrimination for those living with HIV. Such attitude of those working in medical space is unbecoming and will create hardships for those trying to access healthcare services in public hospitals. We will never be able to end the stigma if it exists in medical settings,” Borges said.","['reveals', 'man', 'gmc', 'kin', 'board', 'hospital', 'status', 'trauma', 'health', 'family', 'patients', 'patient', 'bed', 'identity', 'medical', 'hiv']","This single insensitive act by the state’s premier hospital will only serve to dissuade others from seeking treatment.

Besides physical, prevalence of mental health problems such as depression is alarmingly high.AIDS-related deaths have dropped by 54% and new infections by 66% in India over a decade, but children like Sumana are a testimony to the gaping deficit in the national programme that focuses on drugs instead of a holistic medical, nutritional and psychosocial model that a complex disease such as HIV warrants. A little over a quarter of the 60,000 such children are in Maharashtra.An otherwise spirited child, Sumant gets drowsy and irritable after taking medicines. “I get severe stomach-ache, dizziness, headache and diarrhoea,'' he says, describing his plight after taking the daily dose of antiretroviral therapy (ART) medicines. Born with the virus, these children need to take two to six capsules daily. For additional infections such as tuberculosis, the pill count could run into double digits. Their very survival depends on following this regimen, but the six-year-old Sumant is among 17 children at the Palawi home who refuse to continue with ART .“Children go through hell in spite of ART. There is no denying the dramatic shift in HIV care today, but what about those who got the disease at the turn of the century and have spent a lifetime taking medicines. We know little or nothing about what the virus or ART does to each child?” said Palawi's founder, 65-year-old Mangaltai Shah. She says most children in Palawi grapple with problems ranging from skin rashes, oral and vaginal yeast infections, pus accumulation in ears, hearing and vision problems to life-threatening infections such as TB. “So when medicines meant to heal start giving additional trouble, they find it easier to discard.” Moreover, she adds, at Rs 25 per child per day institutions like Palawi neither have adequate funds nor support from government hospitals to tackle the unique health problems of each child.Sumant is supposed to receive intensive counselling from the local ART centre till his adherence improves, but Shah says the three doctors and four counsellors that cater to 300 HIV patients daily at Solapur Civil Hospital barely have the time to look up. For nearly 3 lakh registered HIV patients in the state, there are less than 1,000 counsellors. Another Palawi resident, four-year-old Khusboo, suffered hearing loss after recurrent ear infections. The diagnosis didn't come from the ART centre, but from her teacher at Palawi’s in-house Gyan Mandir school, who noticed Khusboo was oblivious to classroom activities.The institution was compelled to start its own school in 2014—a ground-plus-one structure next to the orphanage on Pandharpur’s outskirts—as children are denied admission in regular schools the moment Palawi is mentioned. But it’s a blessing in disguise for these children who struggle to sit through more than one or two classes without dozing off. “A regular school wouldn’t understand or probably tolerate it,” Patil says. Palawi which has been home to 250 HIV-positive children since 2001, has lost 40 to the disease. AIDS claims an average of 2,500 lives in Maharashtra annually; how many are children is not known. The state recently discovered that over 30,000 of the two lakh patients on treatment have dropped out. Here too, paediatric percentage is unclear. On paper, 16,000 children in Maharashtra are on treatment.Coping is equally challenging for children in the community, who having lost one or both parents to the virus, face vulnerabilities starting from poor access to healthcare and government entitlements to education and nutrition.Now 17, Palghar native Sachin has been on ART since he was three. He lost his mother at birth and father last December to HIV. He admits to skipping his daily 10-pill regimen. He dropped out of school due to his condition. “The pain would begin after the morning pills. I would cry in class and be compelled to lie down,” said Sachin who can't keep a job either as the medicines make him “drowsy and tired”. At four-feet and grossly underweight at 35kg, Sachin typifies the wasting and stunting associated with HIV.HIV is a neurotropic virus that not just attacks the immune system but practically affects every organ, resulting in damage to nerve tissues, cognitive development, physical growth, and at the same time causing learning difficulties, speech and language problems. Experts say it’s crucial to monitor toxicity and provide 360-degree healthcare. Dr Ira Shah, an expert in paediatric HIV, says it’s not enough to tell children to take medicines lifelong. “These are toxic drugs given at a much younger age. It is necessary to monitor bone health or metabolic acidosis before the children become intolerant,” she said. In one of her published papers, she wrote about three children who died of neurological complications caused by HIV despite their viral load being suppressed with drugs.National Aids Control Organisation deputy director Dr R S Gupta admits little is known about how children cope with ART. But he underlines the fact that “they live longer because of the medicines and the average life expectancy now exceeds 20.” There are side-effects, but “what is important is they are alive”. Ironically, Sumant, Khusboo, Sachin are Indian HIV programme's success stories even though they are not thriving but merely surviving.(Names of all patients have been changed)","['palawi', 'battle', 'maharashtras', 'mental', 'infections', 'children', 'problems', 'despite', 'patients', 'hearing', 'fight', 'kids', 'crippling', 'medicines', 'meds', 'art', 'hiv']","For the nearly three lakh registered HIV patients in the state, there are less than 1,000 counsellors, mostly underpaid, and overburdened with administrative work.

Failure to detect and treat HIV early may not just cause irreversible neurological damages , but also prove fatal for babies.Doctors at the civic-run BYL Nair Hospital recently discovered the worrying trend while analyzing data of 1,410 babies who were tested for HIV between 2015 and 2018 at the reference laboratory in Kasturba Hospital. At six weeks of birth, infants born to HIV-infected mothers are subjected to the first test, which if positive, is repeated immediately. This second test assumes great significance as the child is immediately started on antiretroviral therapy (ART), if this report too comes positive.The study showed that merely 61% of parents returned for the second confirmatory test. “We were surprised to see that so many parents are missing out on the second visit, thereby delaying the child’s treatment,” said Dr Jayanthi Shastri, who heads the molecular lab at Kasturba that receives samples from 36 HIV testing and counselling centres across the city. The laboratory also gets dried blood spot samples from Gujarat, Goa and Madhya Pradesh. “Such a delay is unfortunate as the advances in ART assure that children with HIV escape the serious neurological damages,” she said.Nair hospital’s Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre has found migration to be one of the biggest reasons. “In 70% of these cases, parents are migrants, who come here for child delivery and return to their hometowns. In a small percentage, it’s also the lack of understanding about the seriousness of HIV,” said Medha Deorukhkar, a counsellor at the centre. Around 46% of children were lost to follow-up, the analysis found.The national protocol warrants that babies be followed up to 18 months as antibodies from mother could give out false positivity in tests carried out before that. In fact, regular follow-ups and counselling are crucial not just for HIV-positive babies, but also for negative ones. While India data is scarce, it has been found that babies who have escaped contracting the virus during birth may still get it through breastfeeding. “Counselling is crucial as mothers may not comprehend the harm of switching between breast milk to formula milk,” said a doctor from Sion hospital’s paediatric centre of excellence for HIV. “Bottle feeds cause ulceration on the gut wall, which makes it conducive for the virus to enter the baby’s bloodstream.”Dr Shikala Acharya, assistant project director at Mumbai District Aids Control Society, said while mother-to-child transmission has dropped to less than 0.2%, tracking remains a challenge. In 2017-18, of around 460 deliveries in HIV-positive women, four babies tested positive. She said in families where the couple has not informed extended family, pursuing them to return for testing of the child becomes difficult.But Dr Anju Seth, director of paediatrics at Delhi’s Lady Hardinge Medical College, said it’s worth the effort as virus suppression is crucial here. “The first three years of a child’s life is when maximum growth happens. If the virus is not controlled, damages like stunting of height, weight and developmental milestones could be permanent.”","['treatment', 'babies', 'test', 'testing', 'counselling', 'study', 'return', 'newborns', 'parents', 'timely', 'second', 'virus', 'miss', 'hivpositive', 'hiv']","MUMBAI: Four out of 10 HIV-positive newborns in the city could be missing out on timely treatment as their parents fail to return for a confirmatory diagnosis .

It has also adopted ""test and treat"" policy which means any person testing positive will be entitled for free treatment by the state and central government. Earlier, this was restricted by a CD4 count rate.* It also provides for confidentiality of HIV-related information and makes it necessary to get informed consent for undertaking HIV tests, medical treatment and research.* The law makes it mandatory for state governments to appoint an Ombudsman to inquire into complaints related to the violation of the Act and the provision of health care services.* If a person or an institution fails to comply with any order given by the Ombudsman within the stipulated period of time, they could be fined a maximum of Rs 10,000. A continuous failure could lead to an additional fine of up to Rs 5000 every day until the they comply.* The new legislation has provisions to safeguard the property rights of HIV positive people. Every HIV infected person below the age of 18 years has the right to reside in a shared household and enjoy the facilities of the household.* The Bill was initially introduced in Parliament by the UPA government, the amendments to the HIV and AIDS (Prevention and Control) Bill, 2014 were revived by the Narendra Modi government in July last year.* The total number of people living with HIV in India is estimated at 21.17 lakhs, whereas around 86000 new HIV infections were reported in 2015, showing 66% decline in new infections from 2000.

They claim the revelation turned their lives upside down, causing them mental agony and pushing them into depression.Halappa KB, 60, and Sushmitha, 21, are residents of Davanagere. Halappa, a labourer, got admitted to City Central Hospital in December 2017 for acute leg pain, followed by blockage in his veins. He alleged that no consent was taken from him for the HIV test nor was he informed while his blood was being drawn. His son Raju H is now running from pillar to post seeking justice and has complained to the consumer court as well, claiming that his father had to face stigma due to the false positive reports.“The hospital conducted an HIV test without our knowledge and consent. It claimed that the report was positive and refused to conduct cardiac surgery on my father. He slipped into depression and even attempted suicide. We brought him to a private hospital in Bengaluru and got him tested for HIV. But the report was negative and he even underwent the operation. My complaint to the health department has been ignored and justice has been delayed,” Raju told TOI.Sushmitha had visited the Davanagere hospital in March for a prenatal check-up when she was five months pregnant. “The blood test was done on March 23. But they asked us to collect the report after three days. We were shocked with the findings — they showed she was HIV-positive — and underwent stress and psychological trauma,” said her husband Prahlad S, a police constable.The couple then went to the government-run Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre for HIV testing. Till then, they had no idea that the report issued by the private hospital was false. “ICTC’s report revealed Sushmitha was not HIV-positive, which came as a huge relief. But the private hospital was firm on its stand. If they had a doubt, they should have conducted another test,” said Prahlad. Sushmitha’s medical negligence complaint with the health department is pending inquiry. Prahlad added that the hospital didn’t even bother to counsel them when they were traumatised after seeing the report.Dr Raghavan GD, district HIV/AIDS control officer, Davanagere, said he was asked by the district health officer to inquire into both the complaints. “In Halappa’s case, the inquiry report has been submitted to the government, but the findings can’t be disclosed. In the other case, the inquiry is yet to begin,” he said.When TOI contacted the hospital authorities, they refused to comment but neither denied nor admitted to the allegations. “The cases are pending before the consumer court. At this stage, we can’t comment on the complaints. We have cooperated with the health department for the inquiry,” said Padmanabh UR, administrator, City Central Hospital.In 2017, the state witnessed a series of protests by doctors when the government initiated amendments to the Karnataka Private Medical Establishment (KPME) Act to regulate private medical establishments. Though the amendments were made, they were called the watered-down version of those intended. In the two cases, the patients have sought action under the KPME Act. “But the Act authorises us only to check and take measures if a hospital/clinic is functioning without registration. Medical negligence cases don’t come under it,” said Dr Raghavan GD, district HIV/AIDS control officer, Davanagere.","['hospital', 'false', 'issued', 'test', 'davanagere', 'file', 'report', 'health', 'plaints', 'department', 'patients', 'reports', 'inquiry', 'medical', 'allege', 'private', 'hivpositive', 'hiv']","BENGALURU: A labourer and a homemaker have filed separate complaints with the health department against a Davanagere private hospital for allegedly giving them false HIV-positive reports .

The results, published Thursday in the Lancet HIV medical journal, may pave the way for other states and countries to stop transmission of the virus with the use of a treatment called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP.""The speed of the decline we’ve seen in new HIV infections in gay and bisexual men is a world first,"" said study leader Andrew Grulich, head of HIV epidemiology and prevention at the Kirby Institute of the University of New South Wales.

While the study results can’t be generalized to indicate similar efficacy in heterosexual populations, they do demonstrate that PrEP is ""highly cost-effective"" in certain high-risk groups, Grulich said in a phone interview.New HIV infections occurred in 102 gay and bisexual men in the state of New South Wales in the first year after the study began, compared with 149 infections in the 12 months prior.""While we’ve known for at least three or four years now of individual-level efficacy of PrEP, there has been some reticence around the world by policy makers to properly fund the roll out of PrEP because the population impact hasn’t been shown -- and that’s what we set out to do,"" Grulich said.There were about 180,000 people in the US taking Truvada for PrEP at the end of June, Robin L.

She alleged that her husband had injected her with infected blood while administrating saline when she was unwell in March last year.”The woman said she underwent clinical tests when her condition deteriorated. “The woman stated in her complaint that she did not have physical relationships with anyone other than her husband,” Mane said.He said the police were yet to investigate if the husband was responsible for administering the HIV-infected blood into her body. “Based on her complaint, we have booked her husband and sent her blood samples to a laboratory,” Mane said.Infectious disease expert Bharat Purandare said, “It is possible to transmit HIV either through an infected needle or by giving transfusion of infected blood. If the woman knows whose infected needle or blood was used to transmit the virus, a DNA test can be carried out on her and the HIV-affected person to establish the link.”The woman stated in her complaint after her marriage in 2015, her husband and in-laws started harassing her for money to start a business. “The woman’s father used to give in to their demands. However, the woman later refused to contact her father for more money, resulting in mental and physical harassment by the in-laws and her husband,” Mane said.The woman said her husband hatched a plot to administer her HIV-infected blood because he did not have strong grounds for a divorce.

In the last five years, over 6,300 women were detected with the virus during pregnancy, underlining the urgent need to reach out to people who may be living with the virus but are unaware of their status.This World AIDS Day, as there is a global clamour for expansion of HIV-testing and treatment under the theme of ‘Know your status’, activists demanded that government agencies must push facilities deeper into the community.Dr Ashok Anand, who heads the gynaecology department at JJ Hospital, that carries out a massive volume of HIV positive childbirths, said even today, hundreds of women find out their status only during their pregnancy.“Most women get the infection from husbands. In fact, many husbands know about their HIV status only when their wives are pregnant,” said Dr Anand. Data from Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) shows that 92% of infections are due to unsafe sex, a significant percentage of which is among heterosexual couples. The remaining are caused by transfusion with infected blood, use of infected needles or from mother to child. Dr Anand said prevention was better as always, as an infected mother also stands the risk of passing on the virus to the child.While with multiple-drug regimen the incidence of mother-to-child transmission has reduced a great deal, some babies continue to get the infection from mothers. Since 2014-15, nearly 300 babies have got HIV infection from mothers in the state. Activist Ganesh Acharya said it was time to remodel targeted interventions and penetrate communities deeper. “We need more behaviour change communication to encourage more to get tested,” he said, adding that people still getting HIV in large numbers suggest that programmes may be failing.Maharashtra State Aids Control Organisation (MDACS) officials said a decade ago more than 4,000 pregnant women tested positive every year. “The number of women testing positive declined by 85% over 10 years, even as women being screened more than doubled,” said a senior official. He said from nearly 8 lakh in 2008, over 21 lakh pregnant women were now being screened annually in Maharashtra.MDACS assistant project director Dr Shrikala Acharya said to facilitate testing BMC has tied up with 113 outlets of Metropolis where HIV test will be carried out for Rs75 for a week from December 1.","['infection', 'women', 'status', 'hiv', 'pregnant', 'testing', 'state', 'positive', '600', 'tested', 'infected', 'virus', 'dips']","MUMBAI: Despite significant progress in containing the spread of HIV among the general population, over 600 pregnant women have tested positive for the virus in the state this year.

Besides, he also set up a shelter home for HIV-positive orphaned children in his hometown Ujjain in 2014.""I was suffering from some health issues and was diagnosed with liver infection.

He was a nice guy with a good heart and he made me laugh. Our conversations soon progressed from chai breaks during lectures to late night calls. We both knew that we were inching towards a proper relationship, but before it was too late to turn back, I had to tell him the truth about myself.The same truth I had kept to myself for so long with no intentions to ever bring up again. But here he was and if anything, he deserved the truth.I was 19 when I started feeling feverish and exhausted all the time. We ran many tests but everything was ruled out. Soon enough, I started feeling severe swelling and pain in my lymph nodes, especially the back of my neck. My body started aching and it started to hurt a lot everywhere. Completely clueless, the doctors kept giving me painkillers and antibioticsAfter three weeks, I met a doctor that informed me that I had contracted the human immunodeficiency virus or HIV. I stood rooted to the ground, while he tried to comfort me saying he would prescribe me some medicines which will help in suppressing the virus.I was devastated to put it simply. I thought being diagnosed with HIV meant that my life was over and I had AIDS. The doctor told me that AIDS was the most serious complication of HIV diseases.The bottom line was HIV was incurable and if left untreated it could go on reducing my T cells. The same cells which fight infection, hence rendering me helplessStrangely, the first person I thought about was Viraat. I had to tell him about everything before things went any further. So, mustering up all the courage in the world, I took a deep breath and said, “Viraat, I have HIV .” In all honesty, I did know how I was expecting him to react. The silence felt like ages and he finally spoke, “I have a lot of questions.”He took a long pause and asked me a lot of questions, the primary one being how well I was taking care of myself and what should he be doing to make my life easier. His genuine concern and warmth seeped through his words. He did not judge me or asked me any questions like where did I contract it from. He was patient and calm and it was pretty much the best reaction I had ever gotten from anyone.Fast-forward 5 years later, Viraat and I are happily married! Obviously, we go for regular check-ups and I have asked my doctor what all can be done to prevent Viraat from getting that virus, apart from protection. The doctor asked him to take a Pre-exposure prophylaxis (or PrEP) pill.

A total of 1,760 people were covered in the drive including 1,195 from the Trichy central prison and special prison for women and 565 people from orphanages, rescue and rehabilitation shelters and old-age homes, that were zeroed in for the programme.Deputy director of medical services, TB control, Dr S Savithri told TOI that all people with symptoms of tuberculosis were tested during the programme. A total of 115 sputum samples were collected. “We utilised this opportunity to cover the vulnerable groups and no one tested positive for TB. Early intervention is an absolute must for efficient treatment of TB,” she said.Though there were no new TB cases at the prisons, there were a handful of existing TB patients and they were being provided treatment. No existing TB cases were reported in other closed settings and state-run homes.While less prevalence of TB among people detected recently might seem to be positive news, according to health officials, prevalence is still high in Trichy city, Manachanallur, Thuvakudi and Thiruverumbur. So far, this year around 2,800 people were said to have received treatment for treatment in the whole district.On the other hand, all adults among the covered population were made to undergo the HIV/AIDS test. “Unlike TB, HIV/ AIDS does not show early symptoms. In some cases, it may take seven to ten years for symptoms to show. That’s why all the adults were tested,” District Aids Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU), S Martin Manivannan said. Though there were no new cases, around seven to 10 HIV/ AIDS patients were inmates at the prisons and none in the other closed settings.Manivannan said that no positive HIV/ AIDS cases was evidence for how much the disease has decreased in Trichy. “Compared to the prevalence rate of 1.91% in 2011, the prevalence is just 0.37% now. Detection drives like the recent ones show how much AIDS has been curbed in the district,” he said.","['prevalence', 'vulnerable', 'treatment', 'prisons', 'cases', 'detection', 'sections', 'dip', 'aids', 'tb', 'trichy', 'hiv']","“We utilised this opportunity to cover the vulnerable groups and no one tested positive for TB.

Unable to convince them, the authorities are now draining the water from the 36-acre lake — roughly the size of 25 football fields — which they hope to refill with water from the Malaprabha canal. The Morab lake is the biggest in Navalgund taluk and the only source of drinking water for villagers and cattle. As of now, villagers trek 2-3km to the Malaprabha canal to fetch water.“This is unfortunate. We have been telling people not to panic as HIV does not spread through water. But the people are not convinced and they have started draining out the lake,” said Dharwad district health officer Dr Rajendra Doddamani. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) spreads only through body fluids. Outside the human body, the virus cannot survive beyond minutes in air or water.Dr Glory Alexander, founder-director of Asha Foundation, which treats HIV+ patients, said it was a case of fear rather than stigma. “It’s sheer ignorance stemming from lack of awareness. When an HIV-positive person dies, the virus also dies. Even if the virus comes out of the body, it cannot survive in water and dies in a couple of seconds. There is no risk of infection spreading from the water,” she said.The body of the woman was found in the lake on November 29. Word immediately spread the water had been contaminated, creating panic. Villagers refused to drink the water and pressured the gram panchayat and the Navalgund taluk administration to drain the lake. Authorities tried to convince the villagers that the water was not contaminated and that they would test the water, but no one relented. The authorities have now deployed 20 siphon tubes with four motors to pump out the water.We found the body in a highly decomposed state,” said Muttanna Bhavaikatti, from Morab village. “We don’t want to consume contaminated water. We are trekking 2-3km to fetch water from the Malaprabha right bank canal that flows through Morab,” he said.Pradeep Hanikere, another villager, said the daily hardship was preferable to drinking water from the lake. “Do the officials drink bottled water if they find dirt or a speck in it? If they can’t, then how can they force us to drink water from the lake where we found the body of a woman,” he said.Another villager pointed out, “We would have consumed the water if it was the body of a normal person, but the woman died of HIV. There is no other way. The authorities must drain out water and fill it with fresh water to save the lives of villagers.”Gram panchayat member Laxman Patil said the villagers refused to see reason, so pipes have been sucking water out for the past four days. “We managed to drain out lakhs of litres, and discharged the water in a nearby stream. We still have to drain water from 60% of the lake and need at least five days to empty it,” he said. There is another problem, though. “The taluk administration wants us to complete the task by December 6. They have warned the Malaprabha right canal will be closed after December 8, so we have to fill the water into lake before that. More than 50 people are involved in pumping out water. We will need 1-2 weeks to empty and fill the lake.”Navalgund tahsildar Naveen Hullur said: “We tried to convince people to drink the lake water but they refused. We offered to conduct tests to prove the water is fit to drink. I will talk to officials to allow us to fill the lake from Malaprabha canal till December 20 or 22.”","['canal', 'woman', 'malaprabha', 'villagers', 'lake', 'drink', 'karnataka', 'drowns', 'body', 'water', 'drain', 'refused', 'virus', 'hiv']","HUBBALLI:The residents of Morab, around 30km from Hubballi, have refused to drink water from their village lake after an HIV-positive woman committed suicide by jumping into it a week ago.

Hinjawadi

There is no law that sympathises with HIV+ patients. We filed evidence which showed that she was terminated illegally and only because she was HIV+ — Vishal Jadhav, advocate representing the woman

Two years after she was dismissed from her job at a pharmaceutical firm after a medical report mentioned that she was HIV+, a 32-year-oldis looking at some semblance of. The labour court has directed the Hinjawadi-based company to pay her full wages for the years she lost out on work, restore her job and give her additional benefits.The woman hails from, completed junior college and got married in May 2002. Afterwards, she and her husband moved to Pune. In 2004, her husband was diagnosed withand died in September 2006. Meanwhile, the woman underwent a medical check-up and found that she, too, had contracted the disease. Neither her in-laws or her parents wanted anything to do with her once this was revealed.But, she was determined to carry on with her life. She underwent medical tests and counselling from the government and from various NGOs where she was advised that since the disease carries major stigma in society, there was no need for her to disclose her condition unless specifically asked. She was also assured that there was likelihood of a proper cure being discovered soon.Since she had no major discomfort or visible deformity, she joined a pharmaceutical company in Pune in 2007. Three years later, in 2010, she moved to another pharmaceutical company inas a junior operator in the production department. She completed all necessary formalities and underwent the medical check-up and physical fitness tests. The company had a medical insurance policy, of which she was a member.In the last week of April 2015, the woman had an ear ailment. It grew increasingly severe and she was admitted to a private hospital in Pune, and later, went to Kolhapur for treatment.She was on leave on medical grounds for almost three months and her leave was sanctioned by the company. She rejoined on July 20, 2015 and had submitted her medical reports for insurance benefits to the human resources (HR) department.That was where things started going downhill. While going through her reports, the HR personnel noticed that she was HIV+. On August 4, 2015, she was asked to resign.Claiming it was forceful termination, she filed a case against the company.Speaking to Mirror, the woman said, “The HR and administration department officials called me to their cabin. Other officials were present, too. They told me clearly that since I am HIV+, the company could not allow me to continue my services. They pressured and coerced me for nearly two hours, though I refused to resign and told them that I am physically and mentally fit. I also explained that I was taking all necessary precautions while working and I was even ready for an alternate job in the housekeeping department as I am in dire need of employment and community support.”“Throughout my five years of service, I did not get a single memo or notice — my professional record is spotless. The company had even given me an increment. All of this happened suddenly and my pleas went unheeded. I was alone in my battle against the company officials and I finally succumbed,” she added sombrely.And, her case could not be fought on grounds of sympathy, as advocate Vishal Jadhav, who represented her, pointed out.“There is no law that sympathises with HIV+ patients. We did not even fight to gain the sympathy of the court. We simply filed all the documentary evidence which showed that she was terminated illegally and only because she was HIV+. The company failed to prove that she had resigned from the job voluntarily or that they had paid her a month’s extra salary on her request, as they claimed. We proved that the resignation which she filed was not a resignation in the eyes of the law,” said Jadhav.“Her work was satisfactory and she was efficient. She is a widow and depends upon her employment simply so she can live with dignity,” Jadhav added.The company, however, denied all the allegations.Advocate NP Noronha, representing the firm, argued that she had resigned due to health reasons. Also, she had already availed of gratuity, bonus, leave and other post-termination benefits. He also submitted that the company officials and staff were already aware of her medical condition.“The HR department never took cognisance of the fact that she was HIV+. They were only worried for her excess absenteeism,” Noronha submitted.The company examined five witnesses in support of its claim, but the court did not find them adequate.Presiding officer of the labour court, Kalpana N Phatangare, stated, “An HIV+ woman, with no means of livelihood other than her job, cannot resign. There is no evidence showing that she was physically unfit and thus made up her mind to resign. On the contrary, the evidence on record shows that she was mentally and physically fit till the date of her alleged resignation. Further, the evidence shows that the company was satisfied with her services. There was no misconduct on her part.”“It can be said that this was not resignation, but termination on the part of the company. And a firm dealing with medicines and providing them to the world shouldn’t have a taken such a decision and victimised the woman,” Phatangare added.","['job', 'woman', 'resignation', 'sacked', 'orders', 'evidence', 'filed', 'company', 'hr', 'justice', 'firm', 'officials', 'medical', 'court', 'hiv']","Meanwhile, the woman underwent a medical check-up and found that she, too, had contracted the disease.
