When we showed her our hostel, she was willing to send Damini here,” says Patil, programme officer of the foundation, adding, “The four children who stay with us have either lost one or both parents.”“We encourage children to stay with their families. Affected kids from the neighbourhood come every afternoon between 1pm and 3.30pm to play,” adds Jerryl.At the hostel, there are bunk beds, food and sanitation facilities, and one full-time caretaker who does housekeeping, cooks and administers medicines to the inmates.“I’m myself HIV positive,” says caretaker Pradnya Manjhewar, adding, “When my relatives came to know that my daughter and I were affected, they threw us out of the house. Now I live with my kid at the hostel.” A part-time house maid also visits and doctor for HIV is called to visit monthly.

Synthetic drugs presently used for HIV treatment have side effects. Researchers hope that since the molecule taken from Aerva lanata is natural, it may not have any negative impact.“We have suggested that medical universities and major research institutions conduct clinical research on our laboratory finding to corroborate the results in patients as we cannot do tests on human beings,“ said Dr Estari Mamidala , one of the researchers.The roots of the weed have been in use by tribals in the forests of Khammam fro ages.Tribals have been using the plant for a number of bacterial and viral diseases. “We collected the weed from jungles as part of the ethnomedical research and found it effective in fighting HIV. In fact, tribals have been using the plant for people with HIV-like symptoms,“ Dr Estari told TOI.Dr Estari along with Dr Rajendra Prasad Gujjeti published the lab results in the latest issue of the Pharmacognosy Journal.“The extracts of Aerva la nata showed inhibitory activity on HIV. The results are remarkable and can be used to develop a new drug for HIV treatment or other infectious diseases caused by the pathogenic micro-organisms, for which plant sterols may play a distinctive role,“ Dr Estari said.

The highest inhibition was 91%.The least percentage of inhibition was 77.5%. This is as against the anti-HIV drug, which showed 91.7% efficacy,“ he said.He said the plant contains certain phytochemical compounds that make it a potential future drug for HIV.

Nearly onethird of PLHIV in Telangana reside in Hyderabad and unscientific administration of drugs will complicate the fight against HIV and Aids.According to HIV rights activists in the city, while antiretroviral treatment is scientifically proved, homoeopathic drugs for HIV are yet to be medically tested. About 1,000 people with HIVAids from Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra are now treated by homoeopaths at the government JSPS College of Homeopathy in Hyderabad. “It is a cause of concern that homoeopathic medicines are given without a scien tific backing,“ said Mujtaba Hasan Askari of Helping Hand Foundation (HHF). He told STOI that the HHF recently conducted a survey in Telangana and found that homoeopathic drugs are prescribed to people with HIV and Aids.“About 1,000 HIVAids cases from Telangana and other states have taken recourse to alternative medicine (homoeopathy). The homoeopathy drugs are given free of cost every Monday and Thursday at the JSPS College of Homeopathy between 9.30am and 1.30pm in a well-organised camp on the sprawling hospital premises at Ramanthapur,“ Askari said expressing fears that drugs not backed by sound clinical trials may only aggravate the problem and increase the burden of disease. “This is a disaster in waiting,“ he added.Doctors warn that if antiretroviral (ARV) therapy is discontinued there is a high risk of resistance to first line ARV drugs. This will be difficult to diagnose and treat the disease. Only a few trained clinicians can diagnose ARV first line resistance and only a small number of ART plus centres can administer second line treatment to HIVAids cases. He said though homoeopathy drugs are given free of cost, the patients are referred to diagnostic centres to get their CD4 count tested.

The Kodambakkam resident is HIV positive and has to forgo a day’s wage to travel to a government hospital in Tambaram. At times when the prescribed medicine is unavailable at the hospital, she has to buy the same from outside at a steeper price. While a weak immune system and lack of a nutritious diet make Siriyapushpam susceptible to frequent bouts of illnesses, she says meeting the increasing medical expense gets harder for her each time.Siriyapushpam’s case is not isolated. A complete absence of insurance cover against opportunistic infections (infections caused due to a weak immune system), affects more than 21 lakh people living with HIV (PLHIV) across the country, including 1.42 lakh in TN.It has been more than a month since the HIV and AIDS (Prevention and Control) Act 2014 came into place, but insurers say, they are yet to get guidelines on including such patients in health, life and critical illness segments. The Act protects PLHIV against denial, termination, discontinuation and unfair treatment with regard to employment, educational establishments, healthcare services, residing or renting property, standing for public or private office, and provision of insurance. But without specific instructions, PLHIV in the country remain without cover.According to ‘India HIV Estimation 2015’ report of National AIDS Control Organisation, there were 21.17 lakh PLHIV, including 86,000 newly infected people in 2015. With the highest prevalence being recorded in Nagaland (1.29%), TN’s prevalence rate (0.27%) was higher than the national average of 0.26%.""I have seen cases where hospitals have refused to conduct surgeries to remove uterine fibroids on HIV positive persons. Others charge two to three times the actual cost to operate. If an insurance scheme is introduced for PLHIV, there would be some regulation,"" Kousalya Periasamy, founder of NGO Positive Women’s Network.According to a 2006 UNDP study on the socio-economic impact of HIV and AIDS in India, a person with HIV bears expenses between `25,000 - `30,000 a year. The situation is worse if the earning member in a family is frequently hospitalised.HIV/AIDS and related complications are excluded from critical insurance covers and insurers say they haven’t received instructions to include it in their policies. Health insurance for groups, however, exists. ""In the group health segment, Cigna TTK offers AIDS/HIV cover up to full sum insured under the global health group policy. It covers Indian locals and expatriates working abroad under one umbrella. This cover is available for employees, dependent spouse and children,"" says Sandeep Patel, CEO and MD, Cigna TTK Health Insurance.Star Health & Allied Insurance provides group cover under the NetPlus policy where the proposal has to come from NGOs or government agencies. However, expenses for HIV treatment are excluded as are people with low CD4 count.""Only if companies take the initiative and insure PLHIV for frequent hospitalisations and opportunistic infections can insurance create an impact and gain public trust,"" says Dr S Prakash, senior executive director, Star Health and Allied Insurance.Others say the new law is a step in the right direction. ""With more such steps and availability of more data to enable pricing of products, we can look towards greater inclusion,"" says Ashish Mehrotra, MD and CEO, Max Bupa Health Insurance.But for rural households, 72% of who, according to a 2014 NSSO study, rely on private hospitals for treatment, retail insurance continues to be a dream. Dr Sathish Kumar, country doctor for Solidarity and Action Against HIV Infection in India said cover for PLHIV from lower income groups particularly need attention. Presently, the collective gets such PLHIV enrolled in the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY). Under the scheme, PLHIV from BPL families can get free hospitalisation up to ₹30,000 per family per year.While increasing medical expenses burn a hole in their pockets, patients say unavailability of medicines at ART (Antiretroviral Therapy) centres forces them to make additional trips to the health centre, which robs them of their day’s income.Nutrition is another aspect which seems to have been brushed aside. Dr P Kuganathan , a former programme officer of the state AIDS control programme and consultant (community medicine & infectious disease) at SIMS Hospital says, ""Medicines will work only if PLHIV take nutritious meals,"" adding that the Centre should implement a scheme similar to the mid-day meal for PLHIV.In December 2013, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) announced that people with HIV or other pre-existing illnesses would need to pay a higher premium for life insurance. It also urged companies to continue insuring individuals who contract HIV after buying the policy. This was two months after it issued draft guidelines asking insurers to provide life cover to HIV/AIDS patients.A lot remains to be done, especially in health insurance. At present, an individual with critical injuries or illnesses such as paralysis or cancer is more likely to getting insurance cover than an HIV positive patient on ART.","['aids', 'positive', 'poor', 'cover', 'hiv', 'plhiv', 'say', 'positives', 'health', 'mirage', 'insurance', 'treatment', 'scheme']","The Kodambakkam resident is HIV positive and has to forgo a day’s wage to travel to a government hospital in Tambaram.

It was a very tough fight because the stigma surrounding HIV was all pervasive. Moreover, most people did not understand the nature of HIV. Practically, everybody assumed that one could get HIV by mere association with a person living with HIV (PLHIV). If I recall, the arguments took about three days, about two days on my part and nearly three quarters of a day on the part of the government. The judges had to be made to understand not only the legalities, but the nature of HIV as it was then understood.The case revolved around the Goa Public Health (Amendment) Act, 1985, which permitted the government to mandatorily, without consent, test a person suspected of HIV and on being so found, an individuals’ confidentiality would be breached in addition to possible isolation and incarceration. This is what I called the isolationist law.We actually lost the case because the Goa bench of the Bombay High Court upheld the amendment except for a partial ‘reading down’, in that the Court allowed the person who was being tested to show by other tests that the person was indeed not HIV positive . This had a very deleterious effect initially as we thought the isolationist law would take root in India.However, Dominic D’souza and I, and other friends and comrades were able to resist the replication of the isolationist law of the Goa model in other parts of the country, which was attempted by the central government.In that we were able to create a certain momentum which inured to the benefit of the PLHIV movement. In fact, Dominic D’souza became the first PLHIV activist not only in India, but in the region.When I met Dominic in his last days in Breach Candy hospital, Mumbai, he virtually, in his usual diplomatic way, extracted a promise from me that I shall work for PLHIV community as a lawyer.This ‘tryst with Dominic’ became an obsession with me from 1992-1997, which resulted in the very famous judgement of the Bombay High Court, Mx v. ZY. This landmark judgement, delivered by Justice Tipnis, for the first time provided for the recruitment of PLHIVs in the state sector. Justice Tipnis held that if the person was otherwise qualified (such as having a diploma, degree, etc), was functionally fit and he did not pose a significant risk of transmission to others in the environment, then HIV could not be the basis of any discrimination from him being recruited in the public sector.The success in the MX v. ZY in 1997 put Lawyers Collective’s HIV work on the map such that a lot of gay people started coming to our office. On looking at the situation of gay men the conclusion was inevitable that Sextion 377 of the IPC was a cause of a lot of gay men’s woes in terms of law.This persuaded us to mount a challenge to 377, which was ultimately done in the Delhi high court successfully in 2011, but unfortunately we faced defeat in the Supreme Court, in 2013. The curative petition is still pending in the Supreme Court.Indeed, Dominic D’souza’s case was the first of many, which laid the roadmap of the now HIV Act. The HIV Act contains what we argued in Dominic D’souza’s case in Goa, such as, no testing without informed consent (Section 5), no discrimination or isolation (Section 3) and no breach of confidentiality (Section 8).India has come a long way in treating PLHIV. However, there is a long way to go. We have to remember that India is the pharmacy of the developing and, partly, of the developed world. From 2000 onwards HIV ART triple combination therapy was supplied by India generic companies around the world, though this therapy ART was available from 1996 onwards in the West.However, we were able to supply that in India from the government sector only in 2004, despite the fact that it was Indian generic companies who were supplying ART to the rest of the developing world. Earlier, one had to reach the level of CD4 count of 350 to be on first line ART, it was then changed to 500 and now, the moment you are tested you are to be treated with ART.India, has now taken a policy decision to test and treat as soon as the person is detected to be HIV positive, which was recently announced by Union minister of health J P Nadda . Though this has been announced, India is still far away from the goal, we don’t even comply with the CD4 500 regime till now.Moreover, the HIV Act, which has been recently passed in a cause for concern because under Section 14 of the HIV Act, a caveat is introduced by providing that treatment services would be provided ‘as far as possible’. It appears to many, including the PLHIV community, that ‘as far as possible’ is an escape route for the government to evade its obligations to the community.Though it’s a concern we still have to wait and watch whether it actually becomes a problem in the future.","['court', 'india', 'work', 'case', 'dsouza', 'hiv', 'lawyer', 'plhiv', 'person', 'goa', 'art', 'dominic', 'act', 'promise']","Dominic D’souzas’ was the first case on HIV to come to the Indian courts .

A FIR was filed on May 5.“There have been cases of sexual harassment in the home and there were reports in the local media that some children might have got infected with HIV.

MUMBAI/GOA: It was Valentine’s Day morning in February 1989, and Dominic D’Souza , a 29-year-old living in Parra, a rural parish of north Goa, had just finished breakfast with his mother and aunt when a policeman arrived and whisked him away.Without being told why, Dominic was hustled around the police station, a hospital and badgered with questions about his sexuality and sex life until he was jolted into realising he was a carrier of the HIV virus.It’s been 25 years since the country’s patient zero of the dreaded scourge, who was the first to bear the brunt of ostracism and whose case became the first HIV-related one to reach the Indian courts, succumbed to AIDS.From being handcuffed and left to rot in an abandoned tuberculosis sanatorium to challenging the Goa Public Health Amendment Act, which called for mandatory isolation of HIV-positive persons, Dominic’s legal, medical and emotional journey irrevocably changed not only his own life but became a rallying cry in the struggle for equal rights to treatment and care for those with HIV in the country.Still fit at the time of arrest, Dominic had all along maintained that he was an HIV carrier but not an AIDS patient even as he was being quarantined with rats. Finally, he legally fought his way out 64 days later. On release, he lost his job but chose not to play the victim. Instead, he became India’s first HIV-positive activist.Goa became a centre of AIDS activism with Dominic setting up Positive People , an NGO for the rights of the HIV-infected. Isabel de Santa-Rita Vaz , his friend who’d rallied around him and continued his mission with Positive People, recounts: “His agony was unbearable for us. Dominic knew it wouldn’t be possible to achieve total freedom from infection but wanted to start an organisation that could combat discrimination.”Although he won a partial victory at first when the state amended the Goa Public Health Act and court made detention optional, Dominic lost his life three years on, at 33. “Dominic lived with AIDS, but he lived not to be ashamed,” read his obituary in Goa’s newspapers in 1992, in keeping with his wishes. “He is survived by his twin brother who lives in Sweden, a sister in Mombasa and another brother in the US,” says Vaz.Today, there are an estimated 2.1 million HIV-positive persons in India. Even though diagnosis is no more a death sentence but a chronic illness for which medicines are easier to access, and one can live longer, regular lives, the challenges are many. The stigma it carries and its association with homosexuality, drug use and sex work still impedes the shift in people’s attitudes, says Vaz, adding that the other big challenge is “funding”.Yet, what happened 25 years ago changed the national conversation on the disease and laid the grounds for thelast month. “The dream of having an integrationist approach which requires testing with informed consent and preserving confidentiality and integration of the individual in society has been passed,” says Anand Grover, Dominic’s counsel, who’s been fighting for HIV patients in court since he first met Dominic. “We not only became good friends but worked to oppose the Centre from adopting the Goa Public Health Act model nationally. That was India’s first movement on HIV issues.”The HIV/AIDS Bill passed by Parliament was drafted by Grover’s Lawyers Collective. But Grover is apprehensive about the ‘test and treat’ policy of providing ART as soon as a person tests positive irrespective of his CD count or clinical stage that it introduced. “India is still far from the goal of complying with the 500 CD count regimen even now,” says Grover. Moreover, the caveat it introduced about treatment services being provided ‘as far as possible’ could be an escape route for government to evade its obligations. A lot remains to be done.”Grover’s resolve was predestined. In May 1992, shortly before his death, Dominic had “extracted” a promise from Grover. “A promise I did not realize would have a profound impact on me. It was May 22, 1992.

The otherwise handsome young man was skin and bones, but he was only interested in what I was doing for HIV issues.

The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) previously recommended ART only for those HIV-positive people whose CD4 count (measure of a type of white blood cells) was less than 350 cell millimeter cube on two occasions three months apart.The new 'test and treat' policy means MDACS has to find the 8,000 people who got themselves tested at various government-run testing centres over the last few years, but were not put on ART because they didn't fulfill the previous NACO guidelines. At present, 33,000 positive people are on ART in Mumbai.“We have asked the various Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) in the city to compile a list of people who tested positive at their centre but are not on ART,“ said MDACS additional project director Dr Srikala Acharya . Considering that ICTCs gets a mixed crowd including migrants, it is not likely to be an easy exercise.“We not only have to locate them, we have to get a fresh CD4 count done. Thereafter, we have to counsel them about taking ART,“ said Dr Acharya. The HIV virus remains asymptomatic for years, and it's only when the viral load increases beyond a limit that HIV-positive people start exhibiting outward symptoms such as weight loss and poor immunity against diseases.“Adherence will be a big issue because why would asymptomatic HIV-positive people take strong medicines like ART,“ said infectious diseases specialist and immunologist Dr Om Srivastava .People need to be counseled about the benefits of ART in the long run (see box).Latest research published in the Lancet said life expectancy for young HIV-positive adults has risen by 10 years in the United States and Europe due to antiretroviral therapy. “This meant many patients can expect to live as long as those without HIV,“ said the Lancet report.Moreover, there could an increase in drug resistance if positive people start ART and discontinue it mid-way. “India has to be ready for people developing resistance to firstand second-line drugs. Adequate stocks of secondand third-line drugs should be maintained,“ said Dr Srivastava, who said the private sector had started its 'test and treat' policy over two years ago.However, MDACS's Dr Acharya said that there were adequate stocks of all ART drug combinations in Mumbai.Another senior doctor in the government sector, howe ver, was skeptical about the 'test and treat' policy. “It seems to be a pharma-driven agenda to boost sales of medicines,“ said the doctor.","['test', 'hivpositive', 'policy', 'ministry', 'line', 'dr', 'positive', '8000', 'hiv', 'treat', 'searches', 'health', 'started', 'treatment', 'mumbai', 'art', 'orders', 'mdacs']","MUMBAI: The Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) has started a painstaking search for 8,000 HIV positive persons since the Union ministry of health issued a circular on May 5 stating that all people living with HIV (PLHIV) be started on anti retroviral therapy (ART) regardless of their blood parameters or age.

He had become familiar with the symptoms while undertaking a survey in the Western Ghats in the late 70s. Two tests later, he was proved right. The man had syphilis, a sexually-transmitted disease the septuagenarian white-coat thought he wouldn't see again.A once common STD in the pre-antibiotic era, the prevalence of syphilis was brought down from 8% of the population to less than 1%. In 2011, the National Aids Control Organsiation (NACO) had announced that the country is on the verge of eliminating the bacterial infection. However, six years on, doctors say they are seeing a rise in those testing positive for syphilis among other sexually transmitted diseases, even as the prevalence of HIV is on the decline.Data accessed by TOI from Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TANSACS) has shown that from 2014 to 2016, the number of those who tested positive for HIV went down from 16,708 to 11,395 ­ a 30% decline, with the number of new cases detected decreasing by half from around 2,700. The second most common STD was Herpes genetalis -marked by genital pain and sores in some, and no symptoms in most --which, too, went down by close to 40% from 2014-2016. The biggest surprise for officials was the increase in syphilis cases from around 1,300 in 2014 to 1,700 the following year.“This could be because of better awareness and surveillance,“ said Dr K Senthil Raj, TANSACS director, adding that many of these cases were picked up in Chennai, Salem and Nammakkal. Researchers say syphilis is on a gradual incline across the country along with other STDs like genital infection caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) and, in some pockets, Herpes genetalis.“And in some groups like men who have sex with men, the prevalence of syphilis is significantly high,“ said Dr R R Gangakhedkar, director-incharge of National AIDS Research Institute. He said the prevalence of HIV has decreased across the country because of better intervention by Anti-Retroviral Therapy centres.“While these centres cut the HIV transmission by 93%, alot of other STDs go missed,“ he added. While the transmission efficiency of HIV is low, varying between one in 100 to one in 1000, syphilis occurs in one in 30 people who has come in contact with a carrier. On the brighter side, he said most of those with STDs come at an early stage because of better awareness and hence treated before complications set in.India records 30 million episodes of STDs annually , of which the government treats about 10 million.While government facilities target high-risk groups like the transgender community , female sex workers and homosexual groups, private labs say they have been seeing a steady increase in those reporting with STDs among the general population, especially in the 18-35 years age group.“We have seen a 20% rise of cases of HPV and Herpes. Some of the STDs are detected when the person presents with infertility-related problems,“ said Dr Anita Suryanarayan, vice-president, operations (south India), Metropolis Healthcare Ltd . While the government has several targeted interventions for promoting safe sex, awareness is relatively low among youngsters from the middle and upper class, she felt.","['stds', 'syphilis', 'cases', 'prevalence', 'groups', 'dr', 'herpes', 'decline', 'hiv', 'sex', 'say']","He had become familiar with the symptoms while undertaking a survey in the Western Ghats in the late 70s.

Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka were the only states to report 20,000-plus new infections in 2016-17. RTI data obtained from the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) showed while the state is recording a year-on-year decline, the rate is less than many other high-prevalence states. The state also reported the most mother-to-child transmissions in the country. In the last five years, at least 10,449 newborns got the infection despite the availability of the triple-drug regimen that cuts chances of transmission by 99%.Head of state-run JJ Hospital in Byculla, Dr Ashok Anand, said they have not delivered a single HIV-positive baby in the last three to four years. “Giving anti-retroviral to babies soon after birth as well as putting the mother on anti-retroviral therapy early has proved to be very effective,” he said. Chetan Kothari, who filed the RTI said, “It is shameful that even today babies are getting the deadly disease when drugs are readily available.”Parimal Singh, who heads the Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS), defended the programme and said not just mother-to-child transmission but HIV among general and high-risk populations has been on a decline. “It must be taken into consideration that we came to the top spot only after Andhra Pradesh was divided. As far as babies getting HIV is concerned, today HIV+ mothers are no longer afraid of giving birth and this is the programme’s achievement,” he said. MSACS’ data shows from 2009-10 when HIV positivity in general population was around 5.23%, it has dropped to less than 1% today.State’s public health minister Dr Deepak Sawant added Maharashtra is in a vulnerable position given the huge load of migration. Data also shows a dip in transmission of the disease among homosexuals, bisexuals and transgenders. A few stakeholders however contest intervention to contain HIV in the state has lost steam. Arup Mukherjee, secretary general of the Nagpur-based Indian Red Cross Society, said a fund crunch has been hampering the project for the last two years. “The attrition rate is huge as NGOs are struggling to pay salaries on time. Often testing kits are not available,” he said.

The move is, however, being seen as a ‘ridiculous’ one by social activists as they see it as an infringement of privacy of people living with HIV.When a 45-year-old HIV patient reached Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre at Sawai Man Singh Hospital to get medicines, the healthcare staff asked her to submit Aadhaar card’s photocopy. “They asked me if I have Aadhaar card and that I should submit its photocopy,” the patient who is taking medicine for HIV for over 10 years, said.The RSACS has sent messages to all its ART centres, which provide medicines to people with HIV/AIDS across the state, to collect Aadhaar from beneficiaries.“Other departments are also linking social benefit schemes with Aadhaar, so we have also decided to link it. But, we have not made it compulsory for getting medicines. If a person does not have Aadhaar, he/she will continue to get medicines. We will not stop providing them medicines,” said Dr S S Chauhan, director, RSACS.In the state, there are 23 ART centres that provide testing and treatment facilities to 55,000 odd people living with HIV.Officials said that Aadhaar will help in keeping a track on beneficiaries (people living with HIV), who go missing during treatment. Also, through Aadhaar, department will ensure that a particular beneficiary is not registered at different ART centres. They will generate a whole database online, which will have their Aadhaar number. If a person goes to an ART for HIV testing, the online software through Aadhaar will detect automatically if he is already registered at some other ART.Reacting on it, social activists are apprehensive that this may increase risk of revealing identity of people living with HIV/AIDS.“HIV is a severe privacy issue. But it has been seen in the past that your Aadhaar is compromised at many places. There are instances of it being stolen. The question arises that how the state government will keep such database safe,” said activist Nikhil Dey.Dey said, “Once it’s leaked, how they (those who get it) will use it. There is a stigma attached to HIV, so it is ridiculous to collect Aadhaar from those who are already marginalised. If they made it mandatory, there are chances of exclusion of those who do not have Aadhaar from getting benefits of government schemes.”Social activists termed the step as “ridiculous”. Collecting Aadhaar from all people living with HIV/AIDS is quite challenging at a time when such people living with HIV/AIDS registered at ART do not share even their original name and address to ensure their original identity is not revealed to anyone, even at ART centres.","['ridiculous', 'social', 'dept', 'medicines', 'patients', 'hiv', 'submit', 'wants', 'living', 'aadhaar', 'state', 'centres', 'art', 'raj']","Jaipur: Those living with HIV will now have to submit their Aadhaar card numbers to Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RSACS).

Cops have booked the man’s sister, a nurse, for allegedly helping him extract their mother’s blood. After the incident, the two-month pregnant woman underwent an abortion.Bandra-Kurla Complex police arrested Abhimanyu Kamble (26) on September 6 for injecting the syringe into his wife’s back after an argument.Kamble and his wife Anita met in 2013 and got married a year later. Barely a year into the marriage, Kamble allegedly began to physically assault Anita. In 2016, Anita lodged a domestic violence complaint against Kamble at Tilak Nagar police station. However, even after the case was filed, things did not improve between them. She filed for divorce.On the day of the incident, the couple was present in court around 2pm, both with their respective relatives, when they got into an argument. A while later, Anita told her parents that she wanted to use the washroom. As she was walking towards it, she felt something pierce her back. She told cops that when she was pulling out the syringe, she was shocked to see her husband nearby, and pushed him.

We have made her an accused in the case too,” said Gadekar. He was arrested, interrogated and released on bail.Police said they have learnt that in her complaint to Tilak Nagar police, Anita also alleged that Kamble would subject her to unnatural sex. “Kamble insisted that if she withdrew her complaint, he would agree to the divorce. She was therefore shocked over the syringe attack,” said an officer. Cops have sent the red liquid for chemical analysis to Kalina forensic science laboratory. She was sent for a medical examination.

While the overall HIV positivity in blood units collected in the city has been decreasing, it seems that the infection rate at the National AIDS Control Organisation-supported blood banks has remained stagnant for the last four years. An average of 480 units of HIV-infected blood is detected every year. Interestingly, HIV positivity in non-NACO blood banks has been showing a steady decrease.A third of the 61 blood banks in Mumbai are supported by NACO and most of these are in public hospitals.Dr Shrikala Acharya, assistant project director of MDACS, said as per National Blood Transfusion Council (NBTC) guidelines blood banks should collect information about donors in case they need to be contacted for counselling or treatment in the event of their reports indicating positive for an infection. “It’s a part of the pre-donor counselling that is supposed to be done before blood collection. It is not mandatory, but it is a part of the guidelines,” she said.Acharya added, “Often blood units are collected through camps, where a person may or may not have given his contact details.

Most of them have been discontinued,” said Pooja Thakur, an HIV activist from Chandigarh.Experts said missing doses, especially when a patient is on second line of treatment, can be very risky. “We have been facing shortage of these medicines for a while, however, this is being resolved. We have tied up with the Punjab State AIDS Control Society, which will give us the medicines. We had been facing the problem for a few days due to cash crunch from NACO,” said Dr Vanita Gupta, project director, Chandigarh State AIDS Control Society (SACS). She also said they would reimburse patients who buy medicines from the market.Countering the version of SACS officials, Pooja said, “The total amount for second line ART amounts to around Rs 5,000 per month. This is unaffordable. How can anyone take a reimbursement when there is no paying capacity?”Out of the 300 patients getting second line treatment from PGI, 30 are from Chandigarh, 90 from Haryana and 120 from Punjab. SACS, which is supposed to procure medicines, blames NACO for the situation, while NACO officials feel otherwise. “We supplied drugs to Punjab a few days ago. There is no shortage of funds from NACO. In fact, it is the responsibility of SACS to provide these medicines,” said Dr J S Malhi, regional coordinator, NACO.According to the Network of People living with HIV/Aids, Chandigarh, second line treatment drugs which are out of stock include Lamivudine, Zidovudine and Abacavir. These medicines are supposed to be given in combination. Missing even one renders the course incomplete. “Even children face the same problem. There are 30 children registered with PGIMER’s ART for second line treatment,” said a doctor at PGIMER.","['ve', 'chandigarh', 'pgi', 'lack', 'line', 'sacs', 'naco', 'medicines', 'hiv', 'punjab', 'pgimer', 'coming', 'treatment', 'art', 'second', 'risk']","PGI is one of the centres of excellence for ART, north of Delhi.“We have been coming across cases where patients have not got medicines for the past three months.

Going by the Data of District Aids Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU), of late, there has been an increase in cases between the age group of 40 to 49 years. Experts say the major reason for the change in trend in the viral disease is due to extramarital affairs.District Program Manager (DPM) of DAPCU, Trichy Dr SM Manivannan says, “The trend has changed after 2011. Analysis shows that the trend is a consequence of illicit affairs among married people. But on the whole, the prevalence of HIV-AIDS is declining.”Earlier, the incidence was prevalent among people in the age group of 30 to 39 years, due to the unawareness of the high risk behavior groups - Female Sex Workers (FSW), Men Sex with Men (MSM) and transgender (TG). “HIV positive was high among the risk behavior groups, but after 2011 the trend declined and common people too have been tested positive,” said Dr Manivannan.Stating that the number of infected people is under control in Trichy district, the DPM said that currently 5,500 people were on Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) treatment here. The number included FSW, MSM, TG and normal people.Few years ago, there was a panic among HIV-infected people that the viral infection was the end of their life. Now, doctors term it as a chronically manageable disease. “If a patient is regularly on ART, the life expectancy of the patient will not decrease,” said Dr R Sharmila at ART Centre inside Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH). ART is a tablet which was prescribed to those who had CD4 count below 300. However, the tablet has been made available to all infected people irrespective of their CD4 count.“The regular follow-up on patients and intake of ART tablet increases the longevity of the patients. If anyone was missing out on treatment, the Target Intervention (TI)-NGOs will keep track of them and bring them back on track for treatment,” he said.","['track', 'extra', 'cases', 'art', 'positive', 'trend', 'dr', 'viral', 'spike', 'hiv', 'tablet', 'tg', 'marital', 'treatment', 'affairs', 'trichy']","TRICHY: Incidence of people tested positive for HIV has witnessed a major change in Trichy .

Though 110 pregnant women were detected HIV positive in 2016-17, the number has decreased as compared to the 2015-16 figures that stood at 153 women affected with the virus.

In another part of the country, a blood transfusion brought Radhika’s* dreams crashing down. But instead of letting their HIV+ve diagnoses fill their lives with negativity, they decided to stay positive. Brought together by a twist of fate and the late Dr Suniti Solomon, the pioneer of AIDS research in India, the couple is now proud parents to a 16-year-old, and productive members of society.""When I was first diagnosed with HIV, I was terrified,"" says Chennai-based Arun, who was referred to Dr Solomon of YRG CARE. ""She reassured me that I could still lead a normal life as long as I took medication, and adopted a healthy lifestyle. Getting to know other people living with HIV helped me overcome my fears,"" says Arun, who gave up smoking and drinking.Two years later, when Dr Solomon asked him if he was looking for a life partner, Arun was ready to take the next step forward. ""I hadn’t told my parents or siblings that I am HIV+ve so they were keen to see me married. I wanted a companion but didn’t want to spoil the life of another person, so I decided to marry a woman who was also HIV+ve,"" says Arun, an engineer.Dr Solomon, who documented the first cases of HIV in India in 1986 among sex workers, took voluntary retirement in 1993 to establish YRG Care. In the latter part of her career — as people began living longer with generic anti-retroviral medications and faced the same pressure at home to get married — she began helping healthy patients find life partners. Though the centre has played ‘matchmaker’ for 30 couples so far, Arun and Radhika’s was the first success story.With Dr Solomon’s encouragement, Arun decided to meet prospective brides. That’s when Dr Solomon heard about Radhika, a young woman from Maharashtra. And once Arun met her and her family, he was quick to make up his mind.Radhika, who takes tuitions at home, was also willing to take the plunge. ""I didn’t want to be alone for the rest of my life, and wanted the emotional support a partner can give,"" she says. The next hurdle was convincing his parents who were still unaware that he is HIV+ve. Arun’s family was quick to come around and the only barrier was language.But there was another, bigger challenge ahead. The couple, who got married in July 2001, discovered that Radhika was pregnant in September. ""We were scared but both of us were on medication and our son, born in 2002, is HIV-ve,"" says Arun.Till today, they have not disclosed their HIV+ve identity to friends, Arun’s family, or their son.""There is still some stigma attached to the disease as people have misconceptions about it,"" says Radhika. ""But there is nothing to fear. We take our medicines every day, eat healthy and go to the hospital every six months to check our CD4 (white blood cell counts) and viral loads,"" says Radhika.Arun says getting married and having a child has given direction to his life. ""If you live on your own, you can get depressed. My outlook to life changed after marriage, and now I have a son to live and work for, which gives purpose to my life,"" he says.He has just one word of advice for people.

The test essentially tells whether the treatment regimen is working or not by measuring the amount of HIV virus in a patient’s blood.The National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) has already shortlisted laboratories across the country that would be scaled up to carry out the tests. However, it may be a while before every patient on antiretroviral therapy (ART) qualifies to undergo the expensive test, which costs between Rs 6,000 and Rs 8,000 in a private laboratory.In 2013, the WHO had recommended the viral load-test be carried out within six months of starting an individual on ART and be repeated at the end of that year. Subsequently, it should be carried out annually. People living with HIV and NGOs have since been fighting for the test to be made routinely available and more accessible.“From February onward, 532 ART centres across the country will have the viral load-testing facility. In the initial phases, it will be offered to children below the age of five years, people taking treatment for five years and those suffering from HIV-TB co-infection. They have been chosen keeping the criticality of their condition in mind. The test will subsequently be available to all 1.2 million people on ART treatment in the country,” said Dr R S Gupta of NACO’s Care, Support and Treatment division. The civic-run KEM and Nair hospitals are likely to be the centres in the city.Currently, the test is selectively offered at the state-run JJ Hospital, where patients have to go through the stringent scrutiny of a committee.“The body takes between four and six months only to decide who will undergo the test. It’s unfortunate that in the absence of a viral load-test, the programme solely relies on CD4 count,” said Ganesh Acharya, a member of the Mumbai Aids Forum (MAF). CD4 is an indicator of the body’s immune system. “But it’s only part information about what the virus is doing with the immune system. A high viral load in the body will usually, but not always, mean a low CD4 count,” said infectious disease expert Dr Om Srivastava, who recommends viral load-testing every six months to one year.“Because of the unavailability of the test, patients also often don’t realize when they have become resistant to the first line or second line drugs,” said Poonam Patkar, secretary of MAF.Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) India that offers viral load-testing to KEM patients as a special model, run in collaboration with the Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS), said they have got great results in picking treatment failures early and improving outcomes by addressing non-adherence in patients. The MSF data collated from KEM has shown that 90% of the patients were responding to the treatment offered under the national programme as their viral loads were suppressed.","['test', 'offered', 'mumbai', 'measure', 'viral', 'soon', 'patients', 'hiv', 'virus', 'blood', 'country', 'treatment', 'months', 'art', 'loadtesting']","MUMBAI: Following years of protest, the Centre is set to roll out the viral load-testing for HIV/AIDS patients in the next six months across the country.

It has been conceptualised by Peter Borges , founder and CEO of the NGO, Human Touch “This club will help young people allocate time to tend to their emotional needs at a critical juncture in their life, where establishing peer relationships is particularly important. Unlike other teenagers, there is a heightened risk among HIV+ adolescents to feel excluded and isolated. They are at a far greater risk of not seeking treatment, or dropping out once treatment begins,” Borges says.There are around 310 children known to be living with HIV in the state, of which around 200 belong to the adolescent age group (10-19 years). A majority live with their families, sometimes with single parents and extended families. There are also a substantial number of orphans, close to 40 of whom are housed in three institutions in Tivim, Cavelossim and Rivona.Although ALHIV still face great difficulties in having their voices heard, they also have the potential to be powerful agents of change. Bloom and Blossom, which will conduct its meetings in the Human Touch office at Agasaim, could be a good place to start.“They will better placed to advocate issues that concern them and should be given opportunities for engagement in policy-making, too. In recent years, discussions on the health such youngsters have taken centrestage at many national and international forums. There is also a demand for a revitalized community-wide response to support them,” Borges says.“Adequate treatment, literacy and the right to make decisions about one’s own health are central to empowering ALHIV to be able to engage in decisions about their own care. Finding innovative ways to establish youth as actors in their own treatment would have onward benefits, as they gain confidence navigating healthcare systems. It would also promote adherence and retention,” Borges adds.","['smile', 'support', 'reason', 'hiv', 'living', 'adolescents', 'touch', 'health', 'borges', 'treatment', 'alhiv', 'risk']","PANAJI: In a unique attempt to provide a support system to adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV), a club dedicated to them will be set up at Agasaim , on Friday.

However, some people living with HIV in Mysuru feel stigmatized as people in the medical profession themselves are looking at them as ‘aliens’ by delaying treatment.Sources in Ananda Jyothi Positive Network, an organization of positive people working for the welfare of community members, claimed that doctors are avoiding treating HIV patients. They claim to have come across two cases wherein HIV patients were asked to wait for some time to get treatment after the doctors learnt they were HIV patients.The first patient, who had a heart ailment, was asked to come back after a few weeks. The second patient, a woman who was suffering from uterine prolapse, was told there were no beds at the hospital, they said.Deepa, a non-community coordinator, claimed that doctors do not deny providing treatment but delay it. “They also ask for proof whether they had given them in writing that they wouldn’t treat them. We have intervened and in talks with authorities concerned to get them treatment,” she added.Treatment for co-infection like tuberculosis is easily available and it is not the case for co-morbidities like tooth ache, heart and kidney problems, claim sources. After the National Community Care Centre scheme, which reserved 10 beds for HIV patients and offered free treatment, was scrapped in 2012, treatment for HIV patients has taken a beating, sources add.AIDS programme Officer (in-charge) Dr C Suvarna admitted that the issue of delayed treatment was raised at a meeting but specific instances were not brought up to them. “No one can deny treatment and in such a case one can complain to us,” she said. The officer however claimed that for medical reasons treatment could have been delayed or postponed. “Moreover, surgeries have to be done under extra care and it would take some time. We can analyse if the case was brought to us and whether it is ‘willful’ delay or not,” she said.Stats:** A total of 18,175 persons have been affected with HIV in Mysuru district.

The number of HIV infected patients which was high in 2008 and 2009 gradually declined, claimed DAPCU officials.The downward trend was attributed to awareness among people about safety measures such as condoms.“The single most important occupation affected by the HIV remains the driver profession. Previously, long distance drivers were vulnerable to HIV infection because of their long separation from their wives and the prevalence of female sex workers. Now, all kinds of drivers have come in the vulnerable group,” said Manivannan.Around 11,000 people were undergoing HIV screening test in all the 33 ICTC in Trichy every month.

As such mothers are motivated, they take medicines regularly, and the fixed dose is continued for a lifetime. When a baby is six weeks old, an HIV test is done. If it turns out to be negative, then the test is done again at six months, and again at 18 months if it is negative. If even after 18 months, the test comes out negative again, then the child is declared HIV-free. Now, if the test turns out positive in six weeks, then the medicine (single dose) is started, and after the HIV test at six months, if it is positive again, then a final test is done at 18 months, and if it is positive again, then the medicine is given for a lifetime.”Sooch further said that earlier, HIV positive women and children were given a single dose at the time of delivery. But now, the treatment is started in pregnancy itself, if the woman is declared HIV-positive, and the medicine for a pregnant mother is a fixed dose combination, but for a child, the single dose continues as earlier.

As such mothers are motivated, they take medicines regularly, and the fixed dose is continued for a lifetime. When a baby is six weeks old, an HIV test is done. If it turns out to be negative, then the test is done again at six months, and again at 18 months if it is negative. If even after 18 months, the test comes out negative again, then the child is declared HIV-free. Now, if the test turns out positive in six weeks, then the medicine (single dose) is started, and after the HIV test at six months, if it is positive again, then a final test is done at 18 months, and if it is positive again, then the medicine is given for a lifetime.”Sooch further said that earlier, HIV positive women and children were given a single dose at the time of delivery. But now, the treatment is started in pregnancy itself, if the woman is declared HIV-positive, and the medicine for a pregnant mother is a fixed dose combination, but for a child, the single dose continues as earlier.

The 36-year-old mother of two dug into his bag to find a sari, a lipstick and wilted flowers. Her husband, she later found, was a bisexual cross-dresser.Four years on, Savitha remains married to the same man. Her voice — narrating her husband’s affairs with other men — is among those documented by researchers who studied HIV-related risks among married men who have sex with men (MSM) and their wives According to a 2012 study by National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), MSM are at 12 to15 times higher risk of contracting HIV compared to other men. The recent study found that the HIV-related risks for the spouses of MSM were multiple, yet they are not covered under any intervention programmes of the government.Forty six MSMs were interviewed across five states including the cities of Chennai and Madurai. Of these, 13 women were aware of their husbands’ sexual orientation. Men in these marriages were the primary decision-makers about sex and condom use.""The men used condoms inconsistently with their male partners,"" said Sunil Solomon of Y R Gaitonde Centre for AIDS Research and Education, a co-author of the study. ""The women in these relationships are vulnerable but rarely feature in the country’s HIV intervention programmes. The initiatives mostly address the experiences and perspectives of husbands and their male partners, but not their wives,"" said Solomon, who facilitated the interviews for two teams from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and Durham University.The few women who were interviewed said they came to know about their husbands’ same-sex preference by accident. The men in the study reported having multiple male, and a few female, extramarital sexual partners.Forty-year-old Vasanth* from Hyderabad, who blamed his family for forcing him to marry, was among those who had not disclosed their orientation to their wives. ""If I tell my wife about my relationship with men, she may harm herself. What will happen if she tells our families? I may be making a mistake, but I cannot trouble her. So my relationship remains a secret,"" he said.The study pointed to the high-risk sexual behaviour among MSM and a higher prevalence of HIV among married MSM than unmarried ones. The pressure on them to conform to heteronormative masculine norms leads to hurried and unsafe sex with multiple partners.Many MSMs are also victims of blackmail. ""Their male partners threaten to expose them to their wives if they don’t listen to their demands. In the process, they end up having sex without protection,"" said Jaya, general manager of Sahodaran, which operates a helpline for the LGBT community in Chennai.Some of the couples surveyed for the study had separated after the women got to know about their husbands’ sexual preferences, while some remained married but no longer had a sex. However, a majority of participants continued to have sex both with their wives and partners. A few of them said they encouraged their wives to have extramarital relationships as they were not attracted to them. Women said they remain in these marriages due to cultural and economic pressures, and some for their children.Some women, described pressure from their husbands to have anal sex against their wishes. ""Accounts from both husbands and wives in our study indicate that husbands are the primary sexual decision-makers; some men clearly consider it a right. The men interviewed said they did not feel that using condom with their wives was ""necessary"", even when they had unsafe sex with other partners. ‘I have a medical check-up every three months, so what is the need to use condom with my wife?’ asked a 27-year-old bisexual man in Madurai. Condoms were only seen as a birth control measure and not to prevent sexually transmitted diseases,"" said Solomon. ""But, several participants we interviewed were actively seeking a pregnancy at the time of the interview, and consequently avoided using condoms with their wives,"" he added.The study said there is an urgent need for interventions to address HIV-related risk posed to wives without the unwanted disclosure of husbands’ same-sex behaviour. ""For instance, engagement of these husbands in pre-exposure prophylaxis (taking HIV medicines daily to lower chances of getting infected) could reduce the men’s own risk of HIV, and thereby also reduce the risk of onward transmission to their wives."" Researchers also suggested forming more support groups for these women.(* Names have been changed)","['bisexual', 'wives', 'study', 'hiv', 'women', 'husbands', 'sex', 'msm', 'sexual', 'men', 'partners', 'risk']","Her husband, she later found, was a bisexual cross-dresser.Four years on, Savitha remains married to the same man.

The administration, however, added that the virus didn’t spread inside the jail and the undertrials were already affected.Jailor of Haridwar district jail, S M Singh , said, “The 21 male inmates, aged between 25 and 27, were already affected with HIV. However, they didn’t know that they were carrying the virus. Seven of the 21 are, at present, out on bail and 14 others are being treated by the AIDS control society. They are all small burglars and were arrested in various cases of thefts. All are uneducated and belong to poor families.”He added that most of them are drug addicts, and in all probability, they got infection through intravenous (IV) drug use.Meanwhile, the district administration has asked the jail authority to take proper measures in the matter. District magistrate Deepak Rawat said, “It is a serious matter and all possible steps are being taken to check the spread of the infection within the jail. Proper medical treatment is being administered to all the affected inmates. The narcotic bureau of Dehradun has also examined the report.”The use of IV drugs such as heroin, cocaine and crystal methamphetamines have increased in the past couple of years in Haridwar, especially in the slum areas of the district.Social worker Vishal Garg said, “IV drugs are easily available at every other medical store in Haridwar. The health department is also not taking any measures to curb the use and sale of the drugs. Earlier, mostly homeless youths used IV drugs but now youngsters living in the slums have also started buying these drugs, which is a major cause of HIV spread.”Amarjeet Singh, SHO of Jwalapur police station, said, “A packet of IV drugs is sold for Rs 250 and because of its easy availability and low cost people are buying it. We had recently taken action against two medical stores in Jwalapur area for selling intravenous drugs used by addicts.
